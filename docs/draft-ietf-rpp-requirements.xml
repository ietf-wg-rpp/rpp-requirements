<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This document describes the set of requirements for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP), an Application Programming Interface (API) for provisioning objects in a shared database. RPP is based on the HTTP <xref target="RFC9110"></xref> protocol and the architectural principles of <xref target="REST"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>
<t>In this document the following terminology is used.</t>
<t>REST - Representational State Transfer (<xref target="REST"></xref>). An architectural style.</t>
<t>RESTful - A RESTful web service is a web service or API implemented using HTTP and the principles of <xref target="REST"></xref>.</t>
<t>EPP RFCs - This is a reference to the EPP version 1.0 specifications <xref target="RFC5730"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5731"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5732"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5733"></xref>.</t>
<t>RESTful Provisioning Protocol or RPP - The protocol described in this document.</t>
<t>URL - A Uniform Resource Locator as defined in <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>.</t>
<t>Resource - An object having a type, data, and possible relationship to other resources, identified by a URL.</t>
<t>RPP client - An HTTP user agent performing an RPP request.</t>
<t>RPP server - An HTTP server responsible for processing requests and returning results in any supported media type.</t>
<t>Sponsoring Client - The RPP client that currently has sponsorship of the object.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="conventions-used-in-this-document"><name>Conventions Used in This Document</name>
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="general"><name>General</name>
<t><strong>R1.1.</strong> A well defined architecture MUST be defined for RPP, including a description of the responsibilities of the defined protocol layers.</t>
<t><strong>R1.2.</strong> <em>Removed</em></t>
<t><strong>R1.3.</strong> Wherever applicable RPP SHOULD leverage existing best practices and well adopted standards for building and documenting RESTful APIs. There MUST be a clear justification when deviating from this.</t>
<t><strong>R1.4.</strong> RPP MUST include support for application level status codes, and MAY reuse the EPP status codes defined in <xref target="RFC5730"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>R1.5.</strong>
RPP MUST include support for providing detailed information about application status codes, for example as described in <xref target="RFC7807"></xref></t>
<t><strong>R1.6</strong>
RPP MUST support additional information about a successful operation (information or warning) to convey additional information to the client for example about deprecation or partial success.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="http"><name>HTTP</name>
<t><strong>R2.1.</strong> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <xref target="RFC9110"></xref> MUST be used as the transport mechanism for RPP.</t>
<t><strong>R2.2.</strong> RPP SHOULD use the best common practices for designing HTTP based applications, described in <xref target="BCP56"></xref>. There MUST be a clear justification when deviating from this.</t>
<t><strong>R2.3.</strong> Consistent, predictable and meaningful URL structures MUST be used for identifying, accessing object resources and enable request routing.</t>
<t><strong>R2.4.</strong> RPP MUST use the existing HTTP status codes and MUST define application level status codes and map these to HTTP status codes. RPP MUST NOT redefine existing HTTP status code semantics and when overloading (generic) HTTP status codes with multiple RPP status codes, the provided RPP status code MUST be used by the client to determine the exact nature of the problem.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="rest"><name>REST</name>
<t><strong>R3.1.</strong> The RPP architecture MUST use the principles of the <xref target="REST"></xref> architectural style. A RPP server MUST conform to at least level 2 of the <xref target="RICHARDSON"></xref> Maturity Model (RMM).</t>
<t><strong>R3.2</strong> The RPP architecture MUST follow Resource-Oriented Architecture <xref target="ROI"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>R3.3.</strong> The RPP specification MUST strive to minimise round trips between client and server. Approaches, where client would need to make multiple requests each time to discover resource URL or server capabilities in order to perform operation SHOULD be used sparingly and be always well justified.</t>
<t><strong>R3.4.</strong> <em>Merged with R12.1</em></t>
<t><strong>R3.5.</strong> RPP specifications SHOULD incorporate a machine-readable and well-established API specification, such as [!@OpenAPI] or <xref target="RAML"></xref>. This will facilitate documentation, testing, code generation, and user-friendly extension descriptions. RPP MUST NOT require what API specification technology is to be used. The RPP core documents and extension documents may also choose different API specification solutions, this choice is left to the document authors.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="data-model"><name>Data Model</name>
<t><strong>R4.1</strong> The base data model structures MUST be data format agnostic. It MUST be possible to map the base data model to multiple data formats such as JSON, XML or YAML.</t>
<t><strong>R4.2</strong> Commonly used EPP extensions SHOULD be added to the RPP core data model. An example of this is the DNSSEC extension.</t>
<t><strong>R4.3</strong> RPP MUST allow an extension mechanism that allows clients to signal data omission or redaction, indicating data collected but not transmitted to the registry or redacted.</t>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/34">Issue #34</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>R4.4</strong> RPP MUST have mechanisms to define profiles to indicate:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Required parts of the data model</li>
<li>Mapping definition</li>
<li>Functional subsets for compatibility.</li>
</ul>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/15">Issue #15</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>R4.5</strong> The RPP architecture MUST include loose coupling between the server and the client, allowing for non-coordinated introduction of non-breaking version changes on both sides.</t>
<t><strong>R4.6</strong> A RPP MUST have either a lenient validation mode, where unknown properties are ignored, or a strict validation mode, where unknown properties are treated as an error. The mode is up to client and server policy with mode signalling.”</t>
<t><strong>R4.7</strong> RPP MUST support linking of objects of the same or different types, with flexible cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). The links MUST also support to have attributes of their own (e.g., a link between a domain and a contact object with a different contact role).</t>
<t><strong>R4.8</strong> RPP MUST allow a client to reference a shared object (e.g., a host or contact) sponsored by a different client, while ensuring the sponsoring client retains full administrative control over the shared object.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="data-representation"><name>Data Representation</name>
<t><strong>R5.1</strong> RPP MUST use JSON as the default data format.</t>
<t><strong>R5.2</strong> It MUST be possible to extended RPP to include support other data formats (e.g. XML, YAML).</t>
<t><strong>R5.3</strong> Validation of request and response message MUST be supported for both clients and the servers, in order to determine if the content is valid and no required attributes are missing.</t>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/36">Issue #36</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>R5.4</strong> RPP MUST define a default media type however the protocol SHALL be extensible to enable support for other media types.</t>
<t><strong>R5.5</strong> A client MUST be able to signal to the server what media type the server should expect for the request content and to use for the response content.</t>
<t><strong>R5.6</strong> <em>Removed</em>
</t>
<t><strong>R5.7</strong> RPP SHOULD consider mechanisms for supporting data formats outside of core RPP domain. Especially formats, which lose their properties if transformed, like Verifiable Credentials for contacts which are digitally signed.</t>
<t><strong>R5.8</strong> RPP MUST support partial update of data objects.</t>
<t><strong>R5.9</strong> RPP MUST support full update of data objects.</t>
<t><strong>R5.10</strong> A generated RPP response representation that includes an object identifier (for example a contact handle) MUST also include a URL reference to the location of the object representation.</t>
<t><strong>R5.11</strong> RPP MUST support representation of a collections of resources.</t>
<t><strong>R5.12</strong> The representation of the links (see R4.7) MUST be expressed using the RPP server's internal identifiers. The RPP SHOULD also consider using URIs and/or <xref target="RFC6570"></xref> URI templates for uniform addressing of link targets, both internal and external to the RPP server.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="operations-and-responses"><name>Operations and responses</name>
<t><strong>R6.1</strong> RPP MUST include support for a client requesting different depth of data representations, depending on the use case:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Minimal representation (ID, or ID+name)</li>
<li>Full representation (all data of the object)</li>
<li>Full representation + dereferenced referrals (for example domain with contact and host details)</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R6.2</strong> RPP MAY return different representations of the same object in different contexts:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>GET request to the resource itself</li>
<li>GET request to get a collection of objects</li>
<li>Responses to PUT/POST/PATCH requests</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R6.3</strong> The data representation in a RPP response MUST only contain data related to the object, transactional information MUST be represented as one or more separate HTTP headers.</t>
<t><strong>R6.4</strong> RPP MUST support search for resource collections and SHOULD support filtering (e.g., by name prefix, status, registrar) and pagination.</t>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/56">Issue #56</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>R6.4</strong> RPP MUST support a functional equivalent of the EPP Poll command described in EPP RFC <xref target="RFC5730"></xref>, allowing for clients discovering and retrieving service messages available on the server. The RPP equivalent MAY contain additional options or features for discovering and retrieving service messages, such as:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Allowing clients to subscribe to specific types of service messages.</li>
<li>Allowing clients to receive multiple service messages in a single request.</li>
<li>Allowing clients to use multiple concurrent readers.</li>
<li>Support for streaming service messages to clients.</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R6.5</strong> RPP operations that modify repository state MUST be atomic. A single request MUST either succeed completely or fail completely, leaving the repository in its original state.</t>
<t><strong>R6.6</strong> RPP MUST provide services for the client to assure a re-tried operation changing resource state is executed only once if a request has been terminated or timed out before complete response has been received by the client (idempotency).</t>
<t><strong>R6.7</strong> The protocol specification MUST define the expected server state for a request that times or terminates out before a response is fully sent out the the client.</t>
<t><strong>R6.8</strong> For every request the server MUST generate a permanent, server-unique transaction identifier. This identifier MUST be returned to the client in the response.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="discoverability"><name>Discoverability</name>
<t><strong>R7.1</strong> RPP MAY include a bootstrap mechanism designed to allow clients to locate the network identifier for the RPP service of a registry operator, e.g. rpp.sidn.nl for the registry operator for the .nl ccTLD.</t>
<t>Solutions may include:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>IANA bootstrap Service Registry</li>
<li>DNS TXT records</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R7.2</strong> An RPP server MUST publish a service discovery document in the well-known directory, described in <xref target="RFC5785"></xref>. This document contains structured machine readable information that is required or useful for the client to be able to generate valid RPP requests. The information may contain, but is not limited to:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Available services,</li>
<li>Used Extensions</li>
<li>Versions used for services and extensions</li>
<li>Environment name (production, test etc.)</li>
<li>Server datetime</li>
<li>Maintenance notices</li>
<li>Supported profiles</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R7.3</strong> Server provided functionality, such as the set of supported profiles, languages or extensions, MUST discoverable using the discovery document.</t>
<t><strong>R7.4</strong> RPP MUST support versioning of:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The protocol itself</li>
<li>Data object types</li>
<li>Representations</li>
<li>Operations</li>
<li>Profiles</li>
<li>Extensions</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R7.5</strong> Versioning schema MUST carry information about breaking vs. non-breaking changes and allow clients to decide whether it is able to interact with the server. The versioning scheme SHOULD be like the scheme used for HTTP where minor version changes do not break compatibility.</t>
<t><strong>R7.6</strong> Notices related to scheduled server maintenance timeslots MAY be included in the discovery document, this could be a human readable, non machine parsable character string.
</t>
<t><strong>R7.7</strong> RPP MAY only support a subset of EPP functionality, the supported functionality MUST be discoverable by the client</t>
<t><strong>R7.8</strong> <em>Removed</em>
</t>
<t><strong>R7.9</strong> An RPP response that includes unique object identifiers, MAY also include URL references for these objects.</t>
<t><strong>R7.10</strong> Versions used by the RPP and used extensions MUST be discoverable by the client.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="epp-compatibility"><name>EPP compatibility</name>
<t><strong>R8.1</strong> RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for core EPP functionalities related to domain name, host, and contact objects as defined in <xref target="RFC5731"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5732"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5733"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>R8.2</strong> The automatic or mechanical mapping or conversion between EPP and RPP data model MUST be possible.</t>
<t><strong>R8.3</strong> Compatibility definitions for a RPP to EPP mapping MAY be defined in compatibility profiles (see: R4.4).</t>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/15">Issue #15</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>R8.4</strong> RPP MUST include an extension framework able to define equivalents of most commonly used EPP extensions, which are not a part of core protocol (see: R4.2)</t>
<t><strong>R8.5</strong> EPP password based Authorisation Information defined in <xref target="RFC5731"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5733"></xref> MUST be supported in RPP.</t>
<t><strong>R8.6</strong> RPP SHOULD support client_id/password authentication to match EPP client authentication.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security"><name>Security</name>
<t><strong>R9.1</strong> RPP MUST support state-of-the-art authentication and authorisation schemes allowing for easy integration in modern HTTP infrastructure.</t>
<t><strong>R9.2</strong> RPP MUST support robust authentication and authorisation mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, to ensure that only authorised clients and users can access or modify resources.</t>
<t><strong>R9.3</strong> Support for a simplified and quicker object transfer process MAY be included, where approval from the losing registrar is to be obtained interactively by the registrant during the transfer process.</t>
<t><strong>R9.4</strong> RPP MUST include an authorisation model/framework that goes beyond the current EPP password based Authorisation Information (AuthInfo) used for object transfers. The following use cases MAY be supported:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Object transfers without using an EPP password based Authorisation Information</li>
<li>Registrants using OpenID Connect can interactively allow DNS operator to update their NS records, directly in the registry database or indirectly using a registrar.</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R9.5</strong> All RPP communications MUST use HTTPS (TLS) to protect data in transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.</t>
<t><strong>R9.6</strong> Security mechanisms SHOULD be flexible to allow operators to choose appropriate methods and support federated authentication scenarios.</t>
<t><strong>R9.7</strong> RPP MAY include a mechanism for cryptographic verification of request and response messages as an additional security layer.</t>
<t><strong>R9.8</strong> RPP MUST allow for multiple user accounts linked to a single registrar, registrar user management MAY be delegated to an administrator account linked to a registrar, allowing for self service account management by the registrar.</t>
<t><strong>R9.9</strong> RPP MUST support a granular authorisation matrix, where one or more permissions are coupled to a user account. Allowing for the creation of different types of user accounts, such a readonly users only allowed to fetch data about existing objects, and power users allowed to create and modify objects.</t>
<t><strong>R9.10</strong> RPP MUST allow users to update their credentials and enforce strong passwords and limited lifetime for passwords and other tokens.</t>
<t><strong>R9.11</strong> RPP must support the Least Privilege Principle, to allow server operators to ensure that clients have only the permissions necessary.</t>
<t><strong>R9.12</strong> RPP MUST support secure credentials management, ensuring that credentials are protected against replay and theft, and have limited lifetimes.</t>
<t><strong>R9.13</strong> Any protocol extensions MUST be subject to the same security review and requirements as the core protocol.</t>
<t><strong>R9.14</strong> There MUST be mechanisms to revoke or deprecate credentials, tokens, or permissions when no longer needed or if compromised.</t>
<t><strong>R9.15</strong> RPP must support mechanisms to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks, whether from malicious actors or misbehaving clients. These mechanisms can include rate limiting and throttling of requests with related protocol signalling.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="extensibility"><name>Extensibility</name>
<t><strong>R10.1</strong> The protocol MUST be extensible to accommodate new functionalities, data elements, and operations beyond the initial scope.</t>
<t><strong>R10.2</strong> RPP MUST allow for flexibility in extending the data model e.g. adding new objects or a new attribute to an existing object MUST be possible.</t>
<t><strong>R10.3</strong> RPP SHOULD promote standardisation of commonly used extension attributes.</t>
<t><strong>R10.4</strong> Extensions for new operations on existing resources MUST be supported.</t>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/47">Issue #47</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>R10.5</strong> RPP MUST support extensions that define new status codes not already defined in the core RPP RFCs.
</t>
<t><strong>R10.6</strong> RPP MUST support extensions adding new HTTP headers.</t>
<t><strong>R10.7</strong> RPP SHALL have mechanisms to assure conflict avoidance when extending the protocol, including but not limited to data model, representations, operations, parameters, error codes and signalling. There MUST be a mechanism of conflict-free, non-coordinated extending in private/vendor discretion as well as a coordinated process for core, generic or shared elements.
</t>
<t><strong>R10.8</strong> When a public registry for RPP extensions is required, then IANA MUST be used for this function.</t>
<t><strong>R10.9</strong> RPP extensions MUST include support for versioning, the version of the extension supported by the server MUST be included in the discovery document.
</t>
<t><strong>R10.10</strong> <em>Removed</em>
</t>
<t><strong>R10.11</strong> Extension designers or RPP implementers MAY add new status codes, if a newly created status code is generic enough to be useful for the wider RPP community, then the extension designer SHOULD register the new status code in the RPP IANA registry.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="scalability"><name>Scalability</name>
<t><strong>R11.1</strong> RPP MUST be stateless and MUST NOT maintain application state on the server required for processing future RPP requests. Every client request needs to provide all the information required for the server to be able to successfully process the request. The client MAY maintain application session state, for example by using a JWT token.</t>
<t><strong>R11.2</strong> RPP MUST support cacheability of responses, if applicable to the operation semantics and MUST not include transaction related identifiers and values.</t>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/50">Issue #50</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>R11.3</strong> RPP MUST support load balancing at the level of request messages (URL) and load balancing MUST be possible without processing HTTP body.</t>
<t><strong>R11.4</strong> Every request message MUST at most contain a single object for the server to operate on, with the exception of operations that are explicitly defined as a bulk operation.</t>
<t><strong>R11.5</strong> RPP MUST support asynchronous processing for operations on multiple objects, otherwise resource intensive or involving manual steps. The client request results in a confirmation of receipt and a means for retrieving the final completed processing result at a later time.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="performance"><name>Performance</name>
<t><strong>R12.1</strong> In order to minimise message sizes and needed processing RPP SHOULD be designed not to include a HTTP message body in the request or response when this is not necessary, for example when the required data can be transmitted using the URL and/or HTTP headers.</t>
<t><strong>R12.2</strong> RPP MAY allow for common bulk operations, resource listing, and filtering capabilities. RPP MUST NOT mandate such functionalities where this may impact scalability or performance negatively.</t>
<t><strong>R12.3</strong> <em>Removed</em>
</t>
<t><strong>R12.4</strong> The protocol MUST be usable in both high volume and low volume operating environments.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="internationalisation"><name>Internationalisation</name>
<t><strong>R13.1</strong> RPP MUST support internationalisation, for object types and messages defined in the core protocol and extensions</t>
<t><strong>R13.2</strong> RPP MUST support human-readable localised response messages.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="clients"><name>Clients</name>
<t><strong>R14.1</strong> RPP MUST support server applications as clients. This will be a primary use-case of registry/registrar integration.</t>
<t><strong>R14.2</strong> RPP MUST support interaction from command-line tools or desktop applications capable of sending HTTP requests. These can be generic clients such as <tt>curl</tt> or <tt>Postman</tt> but also specialised RPP command line tools or scripts.</t>
<t><strong>R14.3</strong> RPP SHOULD support web browsers as clients, such as SPA (single page applications) without any proxy backend between web browser and the RPP server.</t>
<t><strong>R14.4</strong> RPP SHOULD support mobile applications as clients, also here through direct integration without any proxy backend.</t>

<section anchor="obj_transfers"><name>Object Transfers</name>
<t>For the purposes of requirements related to transfers, the following specific terms are used:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Gaining Client: The client seeking to gain sponsorship of the object.</li>
<li>Initiating Client: The client that starts the transfer request.</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>O2.1</strong> The RPP MUST support two types of object transfer operations:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">

<li>Push Transfer: Initiated by the Sponsoring Client, who designates a Gaining Client.</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>O2.2</strong> A Gaining Client MUST provide valid authorization information to initiate a Pull Transfer request.</t>
<t><strong>O2.3</strong> For Pull Transfers, the RPP MUST provide operations for the Sponsoring Client to explicitly approve or reject a pending transfer request. The RPP MUST reject any approval or rejection attempts not initiated by the Sponsoring Client.</t>
<t><strong>O2.4</strong> For Push Transfers, the RPP MUST provide operations for the Gaining Client to explicitly approve or reject a pending transfer request. The RPP MUST reject any approval or rejection attempts not initiated by the designated Gaining Client.</t>
<t><strong>O2.5</strong> The RPP MUST provide an operation for the Initiating Client to cancel its own pending transfer request. The RPP MUST reject any cancellation attempts not initiated by the Initiating Client.</t>
<t><strong>O2.6</strong> The RPP MUST provide an operation to query the status of a pending or recently completed transfer request. This operation MUST be accessible to the Sponsoring Client and the Gaining Client.</t>
<t><strong>O2.7</strong> The response to a successful object transfer MUST include a representation of the transferred object and a list of any associated objects that were also transferred.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="domain-object-type"><name>Domain Object Type</name>
<t><strong>D1.1</strong> The RPP domain object data model MUST include, at a minimum, the attributes defined in RFC5731: the fully qualified domain name, repository object identifier, object status, the current sponsoring client identifier, creating registrar client ID, creation timestamp, last update client ID, last update timestamp, expiration timestamp, last transfer timestamp, name servers, subordinate hosts, the registrant, and other associated contacts.</t>
<t><strong>D1.2</strong> RPP MUST only accept valid domain names, which MUST be valid FQDNs.</t>
<t><strong>D1.3</strong> RPP MUST support internationalized domain names (IDN) and accept A-labels and U-labels, also know as IDNA2008 and defined in <xref target="RFC5890"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>D1.4</strong> RPP MUST apply the rules of Label Equivalence as defined in Section 2.3.2.4 of <xref target="RFC5890"></xref> when processing domain names in requests and responses by both clients and servers.</t>
<t><strong>D1.5</strong> The RPP domain object data model MUST allow for the association of zero, one or more host objects to serve as name servers for the domain.</t>
<t><strong>D1.6</strong> RPP MUST support domains that have linkage to at minimum registrant, administrative, technical, and billing contacts. In thin registries, only identifiers MAY be stored; in thick registries, contact data MAY be included per (privacy) policy. The list of contact link types MUST be extensible.</t>
<t><strong>D1.7</strong> RPP domain objects MUST support EPP password-based Authorisation Information (authInfo) for transfer operations (see R8.5).</t>
<t><strong>D1.8</strong> RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for EPP domain status values (e.g., ok, inactive, client/server&lt;command&gt;Prohibited, pending&lt;command&gt;) and define their mapping to RPP responses and HTTP status codes. The protocol MUST define which statuses can be set by the server and which can be set by the sponsoring client.</t>
<t><strong>D1.9</strong> RPP MUST enforce referential integrity. the parent domain name for a subordinate host object MUST not be deleted. RPP MUST return a conflict error when deletion is disallowed and the domain representation MAY include an attribute with information about linked objects.</t>

<section anchor="operations"><name>Operations</name>
<t><strong>D2.1</strong> RPP MUST provide operations to check, create, read, update, transfer, renew and delete domain name objects as defined in <xref target="RFC5731"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>D2.2</strong> When creating or renewing a domain object, RPP MUST allow a client to specify a registration period. The protocol MUST provide a mechanism for the server to confirm the resulting registration expiration date in the response.</t>
<t><strong>D2.3</strong> RPP MUST support the Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping as defined by <xref target="RFC3915"></xref>, the restore report MAY be ignored or included in the initial restore request, making this a 1-step process vs the 2-step process in EPP.</t>
<t><strong>D2.4</strong> RPP MAY support searching and listing domains filtered by name (exact/prefix), and sponsoring client.</t>
<t><strong>D2.5</strong> Only the sponsoring client (or an authorised server administrator) MAY modify or delete a domain object; servers MUST enforce authorisation.</t>
<t><strong>D2.6</strong> RPP MUST prevent creation of duplicate domain objects within a registry namespace (TLD) and return a HTTP 409 (Conflict) status on collision.</t>
<t><strong>D2.7</strong> The transfer of a domain object MUST also result in the transfer of any subordinate host objects (ns.foo.example when foo.example is transferred).</t>
<t><strong>D2.8</strong> The RPP domain transfer operation MUST allow for an implicit renewal. If a transfer results in an extension of the registration period, the response to the successful transfer MUST include the new expiration date of the domain object.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="data-representation-1"><name>Data Representation</name>
<t><strong>D3.1</strong> The JSON representation MUST include the canonical domain name and any U‑label/A‑label when IDN is used by the server.</t>
<t><strong>D3.2</strong> The RPP domain object representation MUST include link relations to related objects, for example: self, hosts and contacts.</t>
<t><strong>D3.3</strong> The representation MUST adapt to the registry model. In thin mode, only identifiers (e.g., contact IDs) MUST be returned; in thick mode, full contact data MUST be returned.</t>

<section anchor="host-object-type"><name>Host Object Type</name>
</section>

<section anchor="contact-object-type"><name>Contact Object Type</name>
<t><strong>C1.1</strong> The RPP contact object data model MUST include, at a minimum an equivalent of RFC5733 contact data model: a unique identifier, repository object ID, current status, name, organisation, full postal address, voice and fax numbers, email addresses,the sponsoring client identifier, the creating client identifier, creation timestamp, the last updating client identifier, last update timestamp, last transfer timestamp, and authorisation information.</t>
<t><strong>C1.2</strong> RPP MUST support server‑generated opaque IDs, support for client‑supplied IDs is OPTIONAL.</t>
<t><strong>C1.3</strong> RPP SHOULD support an explicit indication of entity type (person or organisation) in the contact model.</t>
<t><strong>C1.4</strong> When RPP is used with thick registries, full contact data MAY be returned, for thin registries only the contact identifier MUST be returned.</t>
<t><strong>C1.5</strong> RPP MUST support disclosure and privacy preferences equivalent to EPP “disclose”.</t>
<t><strong>C1.6</strong> RPP MUST support contact object to refer to external identity provider (e.g. when digital identity schemes are used), where the personal data would not be persisted within RPP server. RPP SHOULD allow to only store a stable identifier, reference or credential for future verification (see Privacy Considerations).</t>
<t><strong>C1.7</strong> RPP MUST enforce referential integrity. A contact MUST not be deleted when it is referenced by other objects. RPP MUST return a conflict error when deletion is disallowed and the contact representation MAY include an attribute with information about linked objects.</t>
<t><strong>C1.8</strong> RPP SHOULD consider renaming the EPP contact object type to &quot;entity&quot; to better align with the RDAP data model, defined in <xref target="RFC9083"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="operations-1"><name>Operations</name>
<t><strong>C2.1</strong> The RPP contact object type is mapped to the EPP equivalent and MUST support all operations (commands) defined for the contact object in <xref target="RFC5733"></xref>, such as check, create, read, update, and delete with the possible exception of transfer command, and include support for partial update semantics available to allow for efficient updates.</t>
<t><strong>C2.2</strong> RPP MAY support the contact transfer command from EPP.</t>
<t><strong>C2.3</strong> RPP MAY support searching and listing contacts filtered by name (exact/prefix), and sponsoring client, with pagination, the server MAY use a maximum limit on results.</t>
<t><strong>C2.4</strong> Functional equivalents for EPP contact statuses (e.g., ok, linked, client/serverUpdateProhibited, client/serverDeleteProhibited, pendingTransfer) MUST be supported, with clear mapping to HTTP/RPP responses. The protocol MUST define which statuses can be set by the server and which can be set by the sponsoring client.</t>
<t><strong>C2.5</strong> RPP MUST prevent creation of contacts with duplicate ids within registry namespace (TLD) and return a HTTP 409 (Conflict) status on collision.</t>
<t><strong>C2.6</strong> The protocol MUST provide an operation to retrieve full contact representation. An authorisation mechanism MUST ensure that sensitive data, such as authorisation information, is only returned to the current sponsoring client.</t>
<t><strong>C2.7</strong> The protocol MUST provide an operation to retrieve an appropriate contact representation to non-sponsoring clients. The representation MAY vary depending if the authorisation information is provided - depending on server policy.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="data-representation-2"><name>Data Representation</name>
<t><strong>C3.1</strong> RPP SHOULD consider using JSContact <xref target="RFC9553"></xref> format for contact representation.</t>
<t><strong>C3.2</strong> RPP MUST support contact attribute disclosure preferences per field (or field group) and this MUST be mapped to the EPP disclosure preferences described in <xref target="RFC5733"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="internationalisation-1"><name>Internationalisation</name>
<t><strong>C4.1</strong> RPP MUST support internationalisation (character encoding) for contact objects in the following areas:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>name</li>
<li>address data</li>
<li>any other contact-related data containing human provided or readable text</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>C4.2</strong> RPP MUST support both the localized and internationalized version of the EPP postalInfo element from <xref target="RFC5733"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>C4.3</strong> RPP MUST support internationalised Email addresses <xref target="RFC6530"></xref> in Contact objects.</t>
<t><strong>C4.4</strong> RPP MUST support multiple localised expressions of the same data, e.g. fields mentioned in C4.1 having both international and localised variants.</t>
<t><strong>C4.5</strong> All future RPP contact object extensions MUST be able to handle internationalisation and localisation requirements.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="iana-considerations"><name>IANA Considerations</name>
<t>This document has several requirements for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) that create considerations for IANA. Future architecture and design documents may identify additional needs for IANA registries.</t>
<t>Therefore, the core RPP specifications MUST include &quot;IANA Considerations&quot; sections that formally request the creation of any necessary IANA registries. These sections MUST also provide the initial registration of values defined within those core documents.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>The security section of this document defines the security related requirements for RPP, these requirements MUST be addressed in the design and implementation of RPP. Implementations MUST follow best practices, described in <xref target="BCP56"></xref> for HTTP API design.</t>
<t>RRP core specifications MUST include appropriate Security Considerations sections, specifying implementation and operational security requirements for both RPP clients and servers.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>
<t><strong>DP.1</strong> The protocol MUST provide mechanisms to support the implementation of data privacy principles, such as those found in modern data protection frameworks (e.g., GDPR). These mechanisms MUST support, at a minimum, the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation.</t>
<t><strong>DP.2</strong> To support data minimisation, the protocol MUST allow clients to provide and manage only the data that is strictly necessary for a specific purpose. The protocol MUST also allow for different representations of an object, so that a client can request a representation containing only the data it needs and server can return the data a client is authorised to access (See also R4.3 and R6.1).</t>
<t><strong>DP.3</strong> The protocol's operations and data models MUST be sufficiently flexible to allow an operator to implement workflows for exercising data subject rights, such as access, rectification, and erasure of personal data, in a manner consistent with the operational and policy constraints of the provisioning environment.</t>
<t><strong>DP.4</strong> The protocol MUST provide services to identify data collection policies and privacy practices. Information about data collection, retention, and privacy policies MUST be included in the service discovery document, enabling clients to understand how personal and sensitive data is handled.</t>

<section anchor="essential-extensions"><name>Essential extensions</name>

<aside><t>TODO: These lists are far from being complete -&gt; input from Tiger Team on EPP Extensibility will fill these lists</t>
</aside>
<t>The following list of extensions is considered essential for the completeness of RPP as provisioning protocol for domain names.
The core RPP and its extensibility framework MUST enable creation of those extensions.</t>
<t><strong>A.1</strong> <em>Moved to <xref target="appendix_extensions_optional"></xref> as A2.2</em></t>
<t><strong>A1.1</strong> An extension that allows a DNS operator to update the DNSSEC key material for a domain object. This extension MAY be used by the DNS operator to update the DNSSEC key material for a domain object, without the need for the registrar to be involved in this process.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="appendix_extensions_optional"><name>Optional extensions</name>
<t>The following list of extensions is considered as possible need for certain deployments of RPP, however other solutions outside of RPP would be possible. Therefore RPP and its extensibility framework MAY enable creation of those extensions, however it is not a MUST criteria.</t>
<t><strong>A2.1</strong> An extension that allows generating a representation of a historical overview for an object, e.g. show all events linked to the object (create, update ...). The historical time window is determined by server policy and ist included in the discovery service document.</t>

<aside><t>TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/57">Issue #57</eref></t>
</aside>
<t><strong>A2.2</strong> An extension for a Search API to allow for searching for objects in the registry database. Includes advanced search capabilities for object info request.</t>
