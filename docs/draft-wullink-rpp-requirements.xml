<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This document describes the set of requirements for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP), an Application Programming Interface (API) for provisioning objects in a shared database. RPP is based on the HTTP <xref target="RFC9110"></xref> protocol and the architectural principles of <xref target="REST"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>
<t>In this document the following terminology is used.</t>
<t>REST - Representational State Transfer (<xref target="REST"></xref>). An architectural style.</t>
<t>RESTful - A RESTful web service is a web service or API implemented using HTTP and the principles of <xref target="REST"></xref>.</t>
<t>EPP RFCs - This is a reference to the EPP version 1.0 specifications <xref target="RFC5730"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5731"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5732"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5733"></xref>.</t>
<t>RESTful Provisioning Protocol or RPP - The protocol described in this document.</t>
<t>URL - A Uniform Resource Locator as defined in <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>.</t>
<t>Resource - An object having a type, data, and possible relationship to other resources, identified by a URL.</t>
<t>RPP client - An HTTP user agent performing an RPP request</t>
<t>RPP server - An HTTP server responsible for processing requests and returning results in any supported media type.</t>

<section anchor="conventions-used-in-this-document"><name>Conventions Used in This Document</name>
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="general"><name>General</name>
<t><strong>R1.1.</strong> A wel defined architecture MUST be defined for RPP, including a description of the responsibilities of the definded protocol layers.</t>
<t><strong>R1.2.</strong> The API MUST provide a clear, intuitive, and self-explanatory interface that facilitates seamless integration into existing software systems. Identifiers used in the API MUST avoid patterns, that could conflict with the syntax or semantics of most popular programming languages.</t>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/3">Issue #3</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R1.3.</strong> Wherever applicable RPP MUST leverage existing best practices and well adopted standards for building and documenting RESTful APIs</t>
<t><strong>R1.4.</strong> RPP MUST include support for application level status codes, and MAY reuse the EPP status codes defined in <xref target="RFC5730"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>R1.5.</strong>
RPP MAY include support for providing detailed information about application status codes, for example as descibed in <xref target="RFC7807"></xref></t>
<t><strong>R1.6</strong>
RPP SHOULD support additional information about a successful operation (information or warning) to convey additional information to the client for example about deprecation or partial success.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="http"><name>HTTP</name>
<t><strong>R2.1.</strong> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <xref target="RFC9110"></xref> MUST be used as the transport mechanism for RPP.</t>
<t><strong>R2.2.</strong> RPP SHOULD use the best common practices for designing HTTP based applications, described in <xref target="BCP56"></xref>. There MUST be a clear justification when deviating from this.</t>
<t><strong>R2.3.</strong> Consistent, predictable and meaningful URL structures MUST be used for for identifying, accessing object resources and enable request routing.</t>
<t><strong>R2.4.</strong>  RPP MUST use the existing HTTP status codes and MUST define application level status codes and map these to HTTP status codes. RPP MUST NOT redefine existing HTTP status code semantics and when overloading (generic) HTTP status codes with multiple RPP status codes, the provided RPP status code MUST be used by the client to determine the exact nature of the problem.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="rest"><name>REST</name>
<t><strong>R3.1.</strong> The RPP architecture MUST use the principles of the <xref target="REST"></xref> architectural style. A RPP server MUST conform to at least level 2 of the <xref target="RICHARDSON"></xref> Maturity Model (RMM).</t>
<t><strong>R3.2</strong> The RPP architecture MUST follow Resource-Oriented Architecture <xref target="ROI"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>R3.3.</strong> The RPP specification MUST strive to minimise round trips between client and server. Approaches, where client would need to make multiple requests each time to discover resource URL or server capabilities in order to perform operation SHOULD be used sparingly and be always well justified.</t>
<t><strong>R3.4.</strong> <em>Merged with R12.1</em></t>
<t><strong>R3.5.</strong> RPP specifications SHOULD incorporate a machine-readable and well-established API specification, such as [!@OpenAPI] or <xref target="RAML"></xref>. This will facilitate documentation, testing, code generation, and user-friendly extension descriptions. RPP MUST NOT require what API specification technology is to be used. The RPP core documents and extension documents may also choose different API specification solutions, this choice is left to the document authors.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="data-model"><name>Data Model</name>
<t><strong>R4.1</strong> The base data model structures MUST be data format agnostic. It MUST be possible to map the base data model to multiple data formats such as JSON, XML or YAML.</t>
<t><strong>R4.2</strong> Commonly used EPP extensions SHOULD be added to the RPP core data model. An example of this is the DNSSEC extension.</t>
<t><strong>R4.3</strong> RPP MUST allow an extension mechanism that allows clients to signal data omission or redaction, indicating data collected but not transmitted to the registry or redacted.</t>
<t><strong>R4.4</strong> RPP MUST have mechanisms to define profiles to indicate:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Required parts of the data model</li>
<li>Mapping definition</li>
<li>Functional subsets for compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/15">Issue #15</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R4.5</strong> The RPP architecture MUST include loose coupling between the server and the client, allowing for non-coordinated introduction of non-breaking version changes on both sides.</t>
<t><strong>R4.6</strong> A RPP server and client MUST in default ignore unknown properties of representations however there MUST be a mechanism for a client to signal that a strict handling is wished where unknown fields are treated as error.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="data-representation"><name>Data Representation</name>
<t><strong>R5.1</strong> RPP MUST use JSON as the default data format.</t>
<t><strong>R5.2</strong> It MUST be possible to extended RPP to include support other data formats (e.g. XML, YAML).</t>
<t><strong>R5.3</strong> Validation of request and response message MUST be supported for both clients and the servers, in order to determine if the content is valid and no required attributes are missing.</t>
<t><strong>R5.4</strong> RPP MUST define a default media type however the protocol SHALL be extensible to enable support for other media types.</t>
<t><strong>R5.5</strong> A client MUST be able to signal to the server what media type the server should expect for the request content and to use for the response content.</t>
<t>//removed: see <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/11">https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/11</eref>
//<strong>R5.6</strong> RPP MUST support the use of server profiles to define required components of the data model and/or mapping definitions (see: R4.4).</t>
<t><strong>R5.7</strong> RPP SHOULD consider mechanisms for supporting data formats outside of core RPP domain. Especially formats, which lose their properties if transformed, like Verifiable Credentials for contacts which are digitally signed.</t>
<t><strong>R5.8</strong> RPP MUST support partial update of data objects.</t>
<t><strong>R5.9</strong> RPP MUST support full update of data objects.</t>
<t><strong>R.5.10</strong> A generated RPP response representation that includes an object identifier (for example a contact handle) MUST also include a URL reference to the location of the object representation.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="operations-and-responses"><name>Operations and responses</name>
<t><strong>R6.1</strong> RPP MUST include support for a client requesting different depth of data representations, depending on the use case:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Minimal representation (ID, or ID+name)</li>
<li>Full representation (all data of the object)</li>
<li>Full representation + dereferenced referrals (for example domain with contact and host details)</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R6.2</strong> RPP MAY return different representations of the same object in different contexts:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>GET request to the resource itself</li>
<li>GET request to get a collection of objects</li>
<li>Responses to PUT/POST/PATCH requests</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R6.3</strong> The data representation in a RPP response MUST only contain data related to the object, transactional information MUST be represented as one or more separate HTTP headers.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="discoverability"><name>Discoverability</name>
<t><strong>R7.1</strong> RPP MAY include a bootstrap mechanism designed to allow clients to locate the network identifier for the RPP service of a registry operator, e.g. rpp.sidn.nl for the registry operator for the .nl ccTLD.</t>
<t>Solutions may include:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>IANA bootstrap Service Registry</li>
<li>DNS TXT records</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R7.2</strong> An RPP server MUST publish a service discovery document in the well-known directory. This document contains required or useful information in a structured machine readable format, for a client to be able to generate valid RPP requests. The information may contain, but is not limited to:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Available services,</li>
<li>Used Extensions</li>
<li>Versions used for services and extensions</li>
<li>Environment name (production, test ...)</li>
<li>Server datetime</li>
<li>Maintenance notices</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/8">Issue #8</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R7.3</strong> Server provided functionality, such as the set of supported profiles, languages or extensions, MUST discoverable using the discovery document.</t>
<t><strong>R7.4</strong> RPP MUST support versioning of:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The protocol itself</li>
<li>Data object types</li>
<li>Representations</li>
<li>Operations</li>
<li>Profiles</li>
<li>Extensions</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R7.5</strong> Versioning schema MUST carry information about breaking vs. non-breaking changes and allow clients to decide whether it is able to interact with the server. The versioning scheme SHOULD be like the scheme used for HTTP where minor version changes do not break compatibility.</t>
<t><strong>R7.5</strong> Versions used by the RPP protocol and used extensions MUST be discoverable by the client.</t>
<t><strong>R7.6</strong> Notices related to scheduled server maintenance timeslots MAY be included in the discovery document, this could be a human readable, non machine parsable character string.</t>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/9">Issue #9</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R7.7</strong> RPP MAY only support a subset of EPP functionality, the supported functionality MUST be discoverable by the client</t>
<t><strong>R7.8</strong> <em>Removed</em></t>
<blockquote><t>//SEE: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/21">Issue #21</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R7.9</strong> An RPP response that includes unique object identifiers, MAY also include URL references for these objects.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="epp-compatibility"><name>EPP compatibility</name>
<t><strong>R8.1</strong> RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for core EPP functionalities related to domain name, host, and contact objects as defined in <xref target="RFC5731"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5732"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5733"></xref>.</t>
<t><strong>R8.2</strong> The automatic or mechanical mapping or conversion between EPP and RPP data model MUST be possible.</t>
<t><strong>R8.3</strong> Compatibility definitions for a RPP to EPP mapping MAY be defined in compatibility profiles (see: R4.4).</t>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/15">Issue #15</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R8.4</strong> RPP MUST include an extension framework able to define equivalents of most commonly used EPP extensions, which are not a part of core protocol (see: R4.2)</t>
<t><strong>R8.5</strong> EPP password based Authorization Information defined in <xref target="RFC5731"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5733"></xref> MUST be supported in RPP.</t>
<t><strong>R8.6</strong> RPP SHOULD support client_id/password authentication to match EPP client authentication.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security"><name>Security</name>
<t><strong>R9.1</strong> RPP MUST support state-of-the-art authentication and authorization schemes allowing for easy integration in modern HTTP infrastructure.</t>
<t><strong>R9.2</strong> RPP MUST support modern authentication and authorization standards (OAuth, OpenId Connect)</t>
<t><strong>R9.3</strong> Support for an simplified and quicker object transfer process MAY be included, where approval from the losing registar is to be obtained interactively by the registrant during the transfer process.</t>
<t><strong>R9.4</strong> The RPP MUST include an authorisation model/framework that goes beyond the current EPP password based Authorization Information used for object transfers. The following use cases MAY be supported:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Object transfers without using an EPP password based Authorization Information</li>
<li>DNS operator/DNSSEC signing authority updating the DNSSEC key material</li>
<li>Registrants using OpenID Connect can interactively allow DNS operator to update their NS records, directly in the registry database or indirectly using a registar.</li>
</ul>
<t><strong>R9.5</strong> RPP MUST employ strong authentication and utilize encrypted transport (HTTPS) to protect sensitive data.</t>
<t><strong>R9.6</strong> Security mechanisms SHOULD be flexible to allow operators to choose appropriate methods and support federated authentication scenarios.</t>
<t><strong>R9.7</strong> RPP MAY include a mechanism for cryptographic verification of request and response messages as an additional security layer.</t>
<t><strong>R9.8</strong> RPP MUST allowing for multiple user accounts linked to a single registrar, registar user management MAY be delegated to an administrator account linked to a registrar, allowing for self service account management by the registar.</t>
<t><strong>R9.9</strong> RPP MUST support a granalar authorization matrix, where one or more permissions are coupled to a user account. Allowing for the creation of different types of user accounts, such a readonly users only allowed to fetch data about existing objects, and power users allowed to create and modify objects.</t>
<t><strong>R9.10</strong> RPP MUST allow users to update their credentials and enforce strong passwords and limited lifetime for passwords and other tokens.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="extensibility"><name>Extensibility</name>
<t><strong>R10.1</strong> The protocol MUST be extensible to accommodate new functionalities, data elements, and operations beyond the initial scope.</t>
<t><strong>R10.2</strong> RPP MUST allow for flexibility in extending the data model e.g. adding new objects or a new attribute to an existing object MUST be possible.</t>
<t><strong>R10.3</strong> RPP SHOULD promote standardisation of commonly used extension attributes.</t>
<t><strong>R10.4</strong> Extensions for new operations on existing resources MUST be supported.</t>
<t><strong>R10.5</strong> RPP MUST support extensions that define new status codes not already defined in the core RPP RFCs.</t>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/20">Issue #20</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R10.6</strong> RPP MUST support extensions adding new HTTP headers.</t>
<t><strong>R10.7</strong> RPP SHALL have mechanisms to assure conflict avoidance when extending the protocol, including but not limited to data model, representations, operations, parameters, error codes and signalling. There MUST be a mechanism of conflict-free, non-coordinated extending in private/vendor discresion as well as a coordinated process for core, generic or shared elements.</t>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/10">Issue #10</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R10.8</strong> When a public registry for RPP extensions is required, then IANA MUST be used for this function.</t>
<t><strong>R10.9</strong> RPP extensions MUST include support for versioning, the version of the extention supported by the server MUST be included in the discovery document.</t>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/11">Issue #11</eref></t>

//<strong>R10.10</strong> RPP status codes are maintained in an IANA registry for RPP status codes, these include all status codes defined in the core RPP RFCs and by any
//extension that is also a registered IANA RPP extension.</t>
<t><strong>R10.11</strong> Extension designers or RPP implementers MAY add new status codes, if a newly created status code is generic enough to be useful for the wider RPP community, then the extension designer SHOULD register the new status code in the RPP IANA registry.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="scalability"><name>Scalability</name>
<t><strong>R11.1</strong> RPP MUST be stateless and MUST NOT maintain application state on the server required for processing future RPP requests. Every client request needs to provide all the information required for the server to be able to successfully process the request. The client MAY maintain application session state, for example by using a JWT token.</t>
<t><strong>R11.2</strong> RPP MUST support cacheability of responses, if applicable to the operation semantics and MUST not include  transaction related identifiers and values.</t>
<t><strong>R11.3</strong> RPP MUST support load balancing at the level of request messages (URL) and load balancing MUST be possible without processing  HTTP body.</t>
<t><strong>R11.4</strong> Every request message MUST at most contain a single object for the server to operate on, with the exception of operations that are explicitely defined as a bulk operation.</t>
<t><strong>R11.5</strong> RPP MUST support asynchronous processing for operations on multiple objects, otherwise resource intensive or involving manual steps. The client request results in a confirmation of receipt and a means for retrieving the final completed processing result at a later time.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="performance"><name>Performance</name>
<t><strong>R12.1</strong> RPP MUST NOT include a HTTP message body in the request or response when this is not necessary, for example when the required data can be transmitted using the URL and/or HTTP headers.</t>
<blockquote><t>//TODO: <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-requirements/issues/25">Issue #25</eref></t>
</blockquote><t><strong>R12.2</strong> RPP MAY allow for common bulk operations, resource listing, and filtering capabilities. RPP MUST NOT mandate such functionalities where this may impact scalability or performance negatively.</t>
