1.  Introduction

   This document describes the set of requirements for the RESTful
   Provisioning Protocol (RPP), an Application Programming Interface
   (API) for provisioning objects in a shared database.  RPP is based on
   the HTTP [RFC9110] protocol and the architectural principles of
   [REST].

2.  Terminology

   In this document the following terminology is used:

   REST - Representational State Transfer ([REST]).  An architectural
   style.

   RESTful - A RESTful web service is a web service or API implemented
   using HTTP and the principles of [REST].

   RESTful Provisioning Protocol or RPP - The protocol which
   requirements are described in this document.

   RPP Core - The collection of RFCs describing the RPP architecture,
   data model, HTTP based protocol elements such as URLs and headers.
   This also includes a description of allowed extension points.

   URL - A Uniform Resource Locator as defined in [RFC3986].

   Resource - An object having a type, data, and possible relationship
   to other resources, identified by a URL.

   Extension - A specification that adds functionality to RPP Core,
   within the extensibility framework defined herein.  Extensions MAY
   provide additional features beyond those defined in RPP Core.

   EPP RFCs - This is a reference to the EPP version 1.0 specifications
   [RFC5730], [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733].

   RPP Client - An HTTP user agent performing an RPP request.

   RPP Server - An HTTP server responsible for processing requests and
   returning results in any supported media type.

   Repository Object Identifier (ROID) - A unique, persistent identifier
   assigned by the repository (Registry) to each object upon creation,
   remaining constant throughout the object's lifetime.

   Object Transfer / Transfer Operation - is an Registry operation used
   to manage changes in client sponsorship of an existing object.

   EPP AuthInfo - EPP password based Authorisation Information defined
   in [RFC5731] and [RFC5733].

   Registry - An administrative authority responsible for maintaining
   and operating an authoritative repository of provisioned objects
   within a defined namespace or domain.  For the DNS Top-Level Domain
   (TLD) use case, "Registry" specifically denotes the administrative
   operation of a zone that allows registration of names within that
   zone (see also definition in [RFC8499]).

   Registrar - An entity that acts as an intermediary between
   registrants and the Registry, providing registration services and
   maintaining the Sponsoring Client relationship for registered
   objects.

   Registrant - An individual or organization on whose behalf a domain
   name or other object is registered in the Registry.

   Registry Operator - An entity performing technical operation of one
   or more Registries.

   Thin Registry - A Registry model in which the Registry stores and
   serves only the minimal data necessary for Delegation and
   identification of an object (for example, domain name, registrar
   identifier, status, and Name Server Delegation).  Registrant and
   contact data are maintained by the registrar and are not held by the
   Registry.

   Thick Registry - A Registry model in which the Registry stores and
   serves the complete data set for an object, including registrant,
   administrative, and technical contact information, and other relevant
   attributes required for provisioning.

   Sponsoring Client - The RPP Client that currently has sponsorship of
   the object.

   Initiating Client - In the Transfer Operation - the client that
   starts the transfer request.

   Gaining Client - In the Transfer Operation - the client seeking to
   gain sponsorship of the object.

   Functional Equivalent - A feature or capability in RPP that provides
   the same functionality as a corresponding EPP feature, though the
   implementation mechanism may differ.

2.1.  DNS Terms

   Where DNS-specific terminology is used in this document, the
   definitions from [RFC8499] apply unless otherwise specified.  Key DNS
   terms used in this specification include:

   -  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
   -  A-label and U-label (see also [RFC5890])
   -  Name Server
   -  Zone and Delegation
   -  In-bailiwick and Out-of-bailiwick
   -  Top-Level Domain (TLD)
   -  Subordinate Host (as used in EPP)
   -  DNS Operator

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  General

   *R1.1* A well defined architecture MUST be defined for RPP, including
   a description of the responsibilities of the defined protocol layers.

   *R1.2* _Removed_

   *R1.3* Wherever applicable RPP SHOULD leverage existing best
   practices and well adopted standards for building and documenting
   RESTful APIs.  There MUST be a clear justification when deviating
   from this.

   *R1.4* RPP MUST include support for application level status codes,
   and MAY reuse the EPP status codes defined in [RFC5730].

   *R1.5* RPP MUST include support for providing detailed information
   about application status codes, for example as described in
   [RFC7807].

   *R1.6* RPP MUST support additional information about a successful
   operation (information or warning) to convey additional information
   to the client for example about deprecation or partial success.

   *R1.7* RPP MUST support both Thin and Thick Registry models, and MUST
   allow for flexibility in how much data and what type of data is
   stored and returned by the server, according to the chosen Registry
   model.  The data elements returned is based on what the client is
   authorized to receive.

5.  HTTP

   *R2.1* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC9110] MUST be used
   as the transport mechanism for RPP.

   *R2.2* RPP SHOULD use the best common practices for designing HTTP
   based applications, described in [BCP56].  There MUST be a clear
   justification when deviating from this.

   *R2.3* Consistent, predictable and meaningful URL structures MUST be
   used for identifying, accessing object resources and enable request
   routing.

   *R2.4* RPP MUST use the existing HTTP status codes and MUST define
   application level status codes and map these to HTTP status codes.
   RPP MUST NOT redefine existing HTTP status code semantics and when
   overloading (generic) HTTP status codes with multiple RPP status
   codes, the provided RPP status code MUST be used by the client to
   determine the exact nature of the problem.

   *R2.5* RPP MUST support deployment architectures where intermediary
   proxies route client requests to multiple backend servers (e.g.,
   different TLD Registries).  The protocol MUST enable routing
   decisions based on URL patterns and HTTP headers, maintaining
   statelessness and allowing proxies to operate without parsing request
   bodies.

6.  REST

   *R3.1* RPP architecture MUST use the principles of the [REST]
   architectural style.  A RPP Server MUST conform to at least level 2
   of the [RICHARDSON] Maturity Model (RMM).

   *R3.2* RPP architecture MUST follow Resource-Oriented Architecture
   [ROI].

   *R3.3* RPP specification MUST strive to minimise round trips between
   client and server.  Approaches, where client would need to make
   multiple requests each time to discover resource URL or server
   capabilities in order to perform operation SHOULD be used sparingly
   and be always well justified.

   *R3.4* _Merged with R12.1_

   *R3.5* RPP specifications SHOULD incorporate a machine-readable and
   well-established API specification, such as [!@OpenAPI] or [RAML].
   This will facilitate documentation, testing, code generation, and
   user-friendly extension descriptions.  RPP MUST NOT require what API
   specification technology is to be used.  The RPP Core documents and
   Extension documents may also choose different API specification
   solutions, this choice is left to the document authors.

   *R3.6* RPP architecture MUST define a common pattern to allow a
   single resource to be addressable via multiple, alternative
   identifiers in its URL.  The protocol MUST specify that one address
   is canonical, and any alternative addresses for the same resource
   MUST be treated as aliases resolving to the canonical resource.

7.  Data Model

   Section 7 defines the requirements to data and relationships to be
   modeled in RPP.

   *R4.1* The base data model structures MUST be data format agnostic.
   It MUST be possible to map the base data model to multiple data
   formats such as JSON, XML or YAML.

   *R4.2* Commonly used EPP extensions SHOULD be added to the RPP Core
   data model.  An example of this is the DNSSEC extension.

   *R4.3* The RPP Core specification MUST only mandate data fields that
   are strictly necessary for the technical provisioning and maintenance
   of an object.  All other data fields MUST be optional at the protocol
   level.  A server MUST be able to designate any protocol-optional
   field as mandatory according to its local server policy.

   *R4.4* RPP MUST have a mechanism for defining and signaling profiles
   that enable compatibility across different implementations.  Profiles
   MUST have unambiguous identifiers (e.g., unique names or codes) and
   clearly describe:

   -  The required components of the data model that must be implemented
   -  Defined functional subsets that enable compatibility across
      different implementations.
   -  Versions used by the components, data models and extensions
      support by the client and the server

      |  TODO: Issue #15 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/15)

   *R4.5* RPP architecture MUST include loose coupling between the
   server and the client, allowing for non-coordinated introduction of
   non-breaking version changes on both sides.

   *R4.6* RPP MUST enforce the use of strict validation, where unknown
   properties, query parameters, url segments and RPP specific headers
   are treated as an error.

   *R4.7* RPP MUST support linking of objects of the same or different
   types, with flexible cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-
   many).  The links MUST also support to have attributes of their own
   (e.g., a link between a domain and a contact object with a different
   contact role).

   *R4.8* RPP MUST allow a client to reference a shared object (e.g., a
   host or contact) sponsored by a different client, while ensuring the
   Sponsoring Client retains full administrative control over the shared
   object.

   *R4.9* RPP MUST support the definition of first-class, read-only
   resources whose state is managed by the server.  These resources MAY
   expose logically associated information as sub-resources.

   *R4.10* RPP data model MUST support composition by defining a pattern
   where a resource can contain child resources of same or different
   type, with flexible cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-
   many),that are integral to it.  Such resources MAY be embedded
   directly in the parent resource representation or exposed as sub-
   resources within the parent's URL structure.

8.  Data Representation

   Section 8 defines requirements to wire format of the data defined in
   Section 7.

   *R5.1* RPP MUST use JSON as the default data format.

   *R5.2* It MUST be possible to extended RPP to include support other
   data formats (e.g. XML, YAML).

   *R5.3* Validation of request and response message MUST be supported
   for both clients and the servers, in order to determine if the
   content is valid and no required attributes are missing.

   *R5.4* RPP MUST define a default media type however the protocol
   SHALL be extensible to enable support for other media types.

   *R5.5* A client MUST be able to signal to the server what media type
   the server should expect for the request content and to use for the
   response content.

   *R5.6* _Removed_

   *R5.7* RPP SHOULD consider mechanisms for supporting data formats
   outside of core RPP domain.  Especially formats, which lose their
   properties if transformed, like Verifiable Credentials for contacts
   which are digitally signed.

   *R5.8* RPP MUST support partial update of data objects.

   *R5.9* RPP MUST support full update of data objects.

   *R5.10* A generated RPP response representation that includes an
   object identifier (for example a contact handle) MAY also include a
   URL reference to the location of the object representation.

   *R5.11* RPP MUST support representation of a collections of
   resources.

   *R5.12* The representation of the links (see R4.7) MUST be expressed
   using the RPP Server's internal identifiers.  The RPP SHOULD also
   consider using URIs and/or [RFC6570] URI templates for uniform
   addressing of link targets, both internal and external to the RPP
   Server.

   *R5.13* RPP MUST define a structured data model for all object types
   that require DNS representation (e.g., Host, Domain).  The data model
   MUST support commonly used DNS record types (such as A, AAAA, CNAME,
   MX, NS, DS, TXT) and their standard attributes, such as TTL.  See
   R10.14 for extensibility requirements.

   *R5.14* RPP MUST include support for a client requesting different
   depth of data representations, depending on the use case:

   -  Minimal representation (ID, or ID+name)
   -  Full representation (all data of the object)
   -  Full representation + dereferenced referrals (for example domain
      with contact and host details)

   *R5.15* RPP MAY return different representations of the same object
   in different contexts:

   -  GET request to the resource itself
   -  GET request to get a collection of objects
   -  Responses to PUT/POST/PATCH requests

   *R5.16* The data representation in a RPP response MUST only contain
   data related to the object, transactional information MUST be
   represented as one or more separate HTTP headers.

9.  Operations and request handling

   *R6.1* _Moved to Section 8 as R5.14_

   *R6.2* _Moved to Section 8 as R5.15_

   *R6.3* _Moved to Section 8 as R5.16_

   *R6.4* RPP SHOULD support search for resource collections and SHOULD
   support filtering (e.g., by name prefix, status, registrar) and
   pagination.  This requirement MAY be relaxed when adding the
   described functionality results in a negative impact on performance,
   stability and/or security.

   *R6.5* RPP operations that modify repository state MUST be atomic.  A
   single request MUST either succeed completely or fail completely,
   leaving the repository in its original state.

   *R6.6* RPP MUST provide services for the client to assure a re-tried
   operation changing resource state is executed only once if a request
   has been terminated or timed out before complete response has been
   received by the client (idempotency).

   *R6.7* The protocol specification MUST define the expected server
   state for a request that times or terminates out before a response is
   fully sent out the the client.

   *R6.8* For every request the server MUST generate a permanent,
   server-unique transaction identifier.  This identifier MUST be
   returned to the client in the response.

   *R6.9* RPP MUST support informational and validation functions that
   are not directly tied to a persistent, provisioned object.  These
   operations SHOULD be exposed as read-only resources that represent
   the result of a query or check.

   *R6.10* RPP MUST support a Functional Equivalent of the EPP Poll
   command described in EPP RFC [RFC5730], allowing for clients
   discovering and retrieving service messages available on the server.
   The RPP equivalent MAY contain additional options or features for
   discovering and retrieving service messages, such as:

   -  Allowing clients to subscribe to specific types of service
      messages.
   -  Allowing clients to receive multiple service messages in a single
      request.
   -  Allowing clients to use multiple concurrent readers.
   -  Support for streaming service messages to clients.

   *R6.11* RPP MUST include a Functional Equivalent of [RFC9038] to
   allow clients retrieve service messages including information it may
   not understand due to missing Extension support.

10.  Discoverability

   *R7.1* RPP MAY include a bootstrap mechanism designed to allow
   clients to locate the network identifier for the RPP service of a
   Registry Operator, e.g. rpp.sidn.nl for the Registry Operator for the
   .nl ccTLD.

   Solutions may include:

   -  IANA bootstrap Service Registry
   -  DNS TXT records

   *R7.2* An RPP Server MUST publish a service discovery document in the
   well-known directory, described in [RFC5785].  This document contains
   structured machine-readable information that is required or useful
   for the client to be able to generate valid RPP requests.  The
   information may contain, but is not limited to:

   -  Available services,
   -  Used Extensions
   -  Versions used for services and extensions
   -  Environment name (production, test etc.)
   -  Server datetime
   -  Maintenance notices
   -  Supported profiles

   *R7.3* Server provided functionality, such as the set of supported
   profiles, languages or extensions, MUST be discoverable using the
   discovery document.

   *R7.4* RPP MUST support versioning of:

   -  The protocol itself
   -  Data object types
   -  Representations
   -  Operations
   -  Profiles
   -  Extensions

   *R7.5* Versioning schema MUST carry information about breaking vs.
   non-breaking changes and allow clients to decide whether it is able
   to interact with the server.  The versioning scheme SHOULD be like
   the scheme used for HTTP where minor version changes do not break
   compatibility.

   *R7.6* Notices related to scheduled server maintenance timeslots MAY
   be included in the discovery document, this could be a human-
   readable, non machine parsable character string.

   *R7.7* RPP MAY only support a subset of EPP functionality, the
   supported functionality MUST be discoverable by the client

   *R7.8* _Removed_

   *R7.9* _Merged with R5.10_

   *R7.10* _Removed_. Included in R7.3.

11.  EPP compatibility

   *R8.1* RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for core EPP
   functionalities related to domain name, host, contact, and
   organisation objects as defined in [RFC5731], [RFC5732], [RFC5733]
   and [RFC8543].

   *R8.2* The automatic or mechanical mapping or conversion between EPP
   and RPP data model MUST be possible.

   *R8.3* Compatibility definitions for a RPP to EPP mapping MAY be
   defined in compatibility profiles (see: R4.4).

      |  TODO: Issue #15 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/15)

   *R8.4* RPP MUST include an extension framework able to define
   equivalents of most commonly used EPP extensions, which are not a
   part of core protocol (see: R4.2)

   *R8.5* EPP AuthInfo MUST be supported in RPP.  RPP MUST by default
   support the requirements for Secure Authorization Information for
   Transfer [RFC9154] operational practise.

   *R8.6* RPP MUST support client_id/password authentication to match
   EPP client authentication.

   *R8.7* Where applicable RPP MUST support longer authorisation
   information compared to EPP, metainformation about client software
   and operational environment as well security related information
   (events) in the responses providing a functional equivalence to Login
   Security Extension for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
   [RFC8807].

12.  Security

   *R9.1* RPP MUST support state-of-the-art authentication and
   authorisation schemes allowing for easy integration in modern HTTP
   infrastructure.

   *R9.2* RPP MUST support robust authentication and authorisation
   mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, to ensure that only
   authorised clients and users can access or modify resources.

   *R9.3* Support for a simplified and quicker object transfer process
   MAY be included, where approval from the losing registrar is to be
   obtained interactively by the registrant during the transfer process.

   *R9.4* RPP MUST include an authorisation model/framework that goes
   beyond the EPP AuthInfo used for object transfers.  The following use
   cases MAY be supported:

   -  Object transfers without using an EPP AuthInfo
   -  Registrants using OpenID Connect can interactively allow DNS
      Operator to update their NS records, directly in the Registry
      database or indirectly using a registrar.

   *R9.5* All RPP communications MUST use HTTPS (TLS) to protect data in
   transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

   *R9.6* Security mechanisms SHOULD be flexible to allow operators to
   choose appropriate methods and support federated authentication
   scenarios.

   *R9.7* RPP MAY include a mechanism for cryptographic verification of
   request and response messages as an additional security layer.

   *R9.8* RPP MUST allow for multiple user accounts linked to a single
   registrar, registrar user management MAY be delegated to an
   administrator account linked to a registrar, allowing for self
   service account management by the registrar.

   *R9.9* RPP MUST support a granular authorisation matrix, where one or
   more permissions are coupled to a user account.  Allowing for the
   creation of different types of user accounts, such a readonly users
   only allowed to fetch data about existing objects, and power users
   allowed to create and modify objects.

   *R9.10* RPP MUST include considerations regarding best practices in
   secure handling of credentials, such as usage of strong passwords and
   limited lifetime for passwords and other tokens.

   *R9.11* RPP MUST support the Least Privilege Principle, to allow
   server operators to ensure that clients have only the permissions
   necessary.

   *R9.12* RPP MUST support secure credentials management, ensuring that
   credentials are protected against replay and theft, and have limited
   lifetimes.

   *R9.13* Any protocol extensions MUST be subject to the same security
   review and requirements as the core protocol.

   *R9.14* There MUST be mechanisms to revoke or deprecate credentials,
   tokens, or permissions when no longer needed or if compromised.

   *R9.15* RPP MUST support mechanisms to prevent Denial-of-Service
   attacks, whether from malicious actors or misbehaving clients.  These
   mechanisms can include rate limiting and throttling of requests with
   related protocol signalling.

   *R9.16*: RPP MUST support authorisation of registry operator power
   client or user, being able to either impersonate any of the clients
   of the registry, or act on behalf of registry with elevated access to
   provisioning objects of all registry clients as well as operations
   beyond of what is available to regular clients.

13.  Extensibility

   *R10.1* The protocol MUST be extensible to accommodate new
   functionalities, data elements, read-only resources, operations,
   informational and validation functions, alternative addressing of
   resources, resource linking, and resource composition beyond the
   initial definitions in RPP Core.

   *R10.2* RPP MUST support the Extension of the data model by enabling
   the definition and provisioning of entirely new object types, and by
   providing a standardised mechanism for adding new persistent
   properties to any existing object type.

   *R10.3* RPP MUST define extensibility methods which promote
   transparency and reusability of extension objects, data elements or
   operations in order to minimise multiple concurrent extensions
   realising the same function.

   *R10.4* Extensions for new operations on existing resources MUST be
   supported.

   *R10.5* RPP MUST support extensions that define new status codes not
   already defined in the core RPP RFCs.  Extension designers MAY add
   new status codes.  If a newly created status code is generic enough
   to be useful for the wider RPP community, the designer SHOULD
   register it in the appropriate IANA Registry.

   *R10.6* RPP MUST support extensions adding new HTTP headers.

   *R10.7* RPP SHALL have mechanisms to assure conflict avoidance when
   extending the protocol, including but not limited to data model,
   representations, operations, parameters, error codes and signalling.
   There MUST be a mechanism of conflict-free, non-coordinated extending
   in private/vendor discretion as well as a coordinated process for
   core, generic or shared elements.

   *R10.8* When a public Registry for RPP extensions is required, then
   IANA MUST be used for this function.

   *R10.9* RPP extensions MUST include support for versioning, the
   version of the extension supported by the server MUST be included in
   the discovery document.

   *R10.10* _Removed_

   *R10.11* The protocol MUST support mechanisms for extending standard
   processes, such like delete or create, with additional transient
   parameters or non-persistent data (e.g. intended premium price or
   tier).

   *R10.12* The protocol MUST support mechanisms for extending results
   of an operation with additional transient, non-persistent information
   not defined in the RPP Core (e.g. information about discount applied
   to a create request).

   *R10.13* The protocol MUST allow extensions to add additional
   information to object statuses (e.g. due date of a status).

   *R10.14* The data model MUST be designed to allow Extension for
   future or experimental DNS record types as well as future ways of
   Delegation over DNS (e.g. DELEG).

   *R10.15* RPP design MUST promote cohesive Extension patterns by
   defining a preferred "standard way" for common functionalities.
   Where multiple approaches to solve the same problem may exist, the
   protocol specification SHOULD provide clear guidance on the
   recommended approach to prevent ecosystem fragmentation and ensure
   consistent implementations across different deployments.

   *R10.16* RPP MUST support Extension(s) for the clients to update
   their authentication credentials.

14.  Scalability

   *R11.1* RPP MUST be stateless and MUST NOT maintain application state
   on the server required for processing future RPP requests.  Every
   client request needs to provide all the information required for the
   server to be able to successfully process the request.  The client
   MAY maintain application session state, for example by using a JWT
   token.

   *R11.2* RPP MUST support cacheability of responses, if applicable to
   the operation semantics and MUST not include transaction related
   identifiers and values.

   *R11.3* RPP MUST support load balancing at the level of request
   messages (URL) and load balancing MUST be possible without processing
   HTTP body.

   *R11.4* _Moved to Section 15 as R12.5_

   *R11.5* RPP MUST support asynchronous processing for operations on
   multiple objects, otherwise resource intensive or involving manual
   steps.  The client request results in a confirmation of receipt and a
   means for retrieving the final completed processing result at a later
   time.

15.  Performance

   *R12.1* In order to minimise message sizes and needed processing RPP
   SHOULD be designed not to include a HTTP message body in the request
   or response when this is not necessary, for example when the required
   data can be transmitted using the URL and/or HTTP headers.

   *R12.2* RPP SHOULD allow for common bulk operations, resource
   listing, and filtering capabilities.  RPP MUST NOT mandate such
   functionalities where this may impact scalability or performance
   negatively.

   *R12.3* _Removed_

   *R12.4* The protocol MUST be usable in both high volume and low
   volume operating environments.

   *R12.5* RPP MUST support cacheability of responses, if applicable to
   the operation semantics and MUST not include transaction related
   identifiers and values.

16.  Internationalisation

   *R13.1* RPP MUST support internationalisation, for object types and
   messages defined in the core protocol and extensions

   *R13.2* RPP MUST support human-readable localised response messages.

17.  Clients

   *R14.1* RPP MUST support server applications as clients.  This will
   be a primary use-case of Registry/registrar integration.

   *R14.2* RPP MUST support interaction from command-line tools or
   desktop applications capable of sending HTTP requests.  These can be
   generic clients such as curl or Postman but also specialised RPP
   command line tools or scripts.

   *R14.3* RPP SHOULD support web browsers as clients, such as SPA
   (single page applications) without any proxy backend between web
   browser and the RPP Server.

   *R14.4* RPP SHOULD support mobile applications as clients, also here
   through direct integration without any proxy backend.

18.  Requirements for object types

18.1.  Common requirements

   This section contains requirements commonly applicable to more or all
   object types.

18.1.1.  Generic requirements

   *O1.1* _Removed_

18.1.2.  Object Transfers

   *O2.1* RPP MUST support two types of object transfer operations:

   -  Pull Transfer: Initiated by the Gaining Client.
   -  Push Transfer: Initiated by the Sponsoring Client, who designates
      a Gaining Client.

   *O2.2* A Gaining Client MUST provide valid authorisation information
   to initiate a Pull Transfer request.

   *O2.3* For Pull Transfers, the RPP MUST provide operations for the
   Sponsoring Client to explicitly approve or reject a pending transfer
   request.  The RPP MUST reject any approval or rejection attempts not
   initiated by the Sponsoring Client.

   *O2.4* For Push Transfers, the RPP MUST provide operations for the
   Gaining Client to explicitly approve or reject a pending transfer
   request.  The RPP MUST reject any approval or rejection attempts not
   initiated by the designated Gaining Client.

   *O2.5* RPP MUST provide an operation for the Initiating Client to
   cancel its own pending transfer request.  The RPP MUST reject any
   cancellation attempts not initiated by the Initiating Client.

   *O2.6* RPP MUST provide an operation to query the status of a pending
   or recently completed transfer request.  This operation MUST be
   accessible to the Sponsoring Client and the Gaining Client.

   *O2.7* The response to a successful object transfer MUST include a
   representation of the transferred object and a list of any associated
   objects that were also transferred.

18.2.  Domain Object Type

18.2.1.  Data Model

   *D1.1* RPP domain object data model MUST include, at a minimum, the
   attributes defined in RFC5731: the fully qualified domain name,
   Repository Object Identifier, object status, the current Sponsoring
   Client identifier, creating registrar client ID, creation timestamp,
   last update client ID, last update timestamp, expiration timestamp,
   last transfer timestamp, Nameservers, subordinate hosts, the
   registrant, and other associated contacts.

   *D1.2* RPP MUST only accept valid domain names, which MUST be valid
   FQDNs.

   *D1.3* RPP MUST support internationalised domain names (IDN) and
   accept A-labels and U-labels, also know as IDNA2008 and defined in
   [RFC5890].

   *D1.4* RPP MUST apply the rules of Label Equivalence as defined in
   Section 2.3.2.4 of [RFC5890] when processing domain names in requests
   and responses by both clients and servers.

   *D1.5* RPP domain object data model MUST allow for the association of
   zero, one or more objects representing the DNS configuration of the
   domain including Nameservers.  These may be defined by a reference to
   separate repository objects (equivalent of EPP host objects) or
   aggregate object (equivalent of EPP host attribute).

   *D1.6* RPP MUST support domains that have linkage to at minimum
   registrant, administrative, technical, and billing contacts.  In thin
   Registries, only identifiers MAY be stored; in thick Registries,
   contact data MAY be included per (privacy) policy.  The list of
   contact link types MUST be extensible.

   *D1.7* _Removed_. Included in R8.5.

   *D1.8* RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for EPP domain status
   values (e.g., ok, inactive, client/server<command>Prohibited,
   pending<command>) and define their mapping to RPP responses and HTTP
   status codes.  The protocol MUST define which statuses can be set by
   the server and which can be set by the Sponsoring Client.

   *D1.9* RPP MUST enforce referential integrity. the parent domain name
   for a subordinate host object MUST not be deleted.  RPP MUST return a
   conflict error when deletion is disallowed and the domain
   representation MAY include an attribute with information about linked
   objects.

   *D1.10* RPP MUST provide a mechanism for clients to discover the
   server's supported Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) policies.
   Information such as the identifiers for supported IDN tables,
   applicable language tags, and variant disposition policies MUST be
   discoverable via the service discovery document (see R7.2).

18.2.2.  Operations

   *D2.1* RPP MUST provide operations to check, create, read, update,
   transfer, renew and delete domain name objects as defined in
   [RFC5731].

   *D2.2* When creating or renewing a domain object, RPP MUST allow a
   client to specify a registration period.  The protocol MUST provide a
   mechanism for the server to confirm the resulting registration
   expiration date in the response.

   *D2.3* RPP MUST support the Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping as
   defined by [RFC3915], the restore report MAY be ignored or included
   in the initial restore request, making this a 1-step process vs the
   2-step process in EPP.

   *D2.4* RPP SHOULD support searching and listing domains filtered by
   name (exact/prefix), and Sponsoring Client.

   *D2.5* Only the Sponsoring Client (or an authorised server
   administrator) MAY modify or delete a domain object; servers MUST
   enforce authorisation.

   *D2.6* RPP MUST prevent creation of duplicate domain objects within a
   Registry namespace (TLD) and return a HTTP 409 (Conflict) status on
   collision.

   *D2.7* The transfer of a domain object MUST also result in the
   transfer of any subordinate host objects (ns.foo.example when
   foo.example is transferred).

   *D2.8* RPP domain Transfer Operation MUST allow for an implicit
   renewal.  If a transfer results in an extension of the registration
   period, the response to the successful transfer MUST include the new
   expiration date of the domain object.

   *D2.9* RPP domain Transfer Operation SHOULD support optional update
   of DNSSEC and Delegation information directly with the transfer
   request.  This feature, as not standard EPP feature, SHALL be
   optional to be supported by server policy.

18.2.3.  Data Representation

   *D3.1* The JSON representation MUST include the canonical domain name
   and any U-label/A-label when IDN is used by the server.

   *D3.2* RPP domain object representation MUST include link relations
   to related objects, for example: self, hosts and contacts.

   *D3.3* The representation MUST adapt to the Registry model.  In thin
   mode, only identifiers (e.g., contact IDs) MUST be returned; in thick
   mode, full contact data MUST be returned.

18.2.4.  Specific Considerations

18.2.4.1.  Embedding of EPP extensions

   *D4.1* RPP Core protocol MUST incorporate Functional Equivalent of
   the following list of widely used and considered essential EPP
   extensions as recommended in [TigerTeamRecc]:

   -  Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions Mapping for the
      Extensible Provisioning Protocol [RFC5910]
   -  Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping for the Extensible
      Provisioning Protocol [RFC3915]
   -  Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) mapping for DNS Time-To-
      Live (TTL) values [RFC9803]
   -  Organization Extension for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
      [RFC8544]

18.3.  Host Object Type

18.3.1.  Data Model

   *H1.1* RPP host object data model MUST include, at a minimum: fully
   qualified host name, all associated IP addresses (see: R5.13),
   Repository Object Identifier, object status, current Sponsoring
   Client identifier, creating client identifier, creation timestamp,
   last updating client identifier, last update timestamp, the last
   transfer timestamp.

   *H1.2* RPP MUST map the EPP host attribute model to the generic JSON
   DNS model defined by RPP (see: R5.13).

   *H1.3* Host names MUST be valid FQDNs.

   *H1.4* RPP MUST support internationalized domain names (IDN) for host
   names and accept A-labels and U-labels, also know as IDNA2008 and
   defined in [RFC5890].

   *H1.5* RPP MUST apply the rules of Label Equivalence as defined in
   Section 2.3.2.4 of [RFC5890] when processing host names in requests
   and responses by both clients and servers.

   *H1.6* When used for linking a Name Server to a domain name, RPP MUST
   support both In-bailiwick and Out-of-bailiwick host objects.

   *H1.7* RPP MUST support zero or more IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) for
   host objects, when the host object is used for linking a Name Server
   to a domain name.  Addresses MUST be syntactically valid, normalised,
   and unique within the host.  The maximum number of allowed addressess
   and any disallowed ranges (e.g., [RFC1918]) are server policy.  The
   server MAY require, make optional or disallow IP addresses depending
   on whether host is In-bailiwick or Out-of-bailiwick.  This is also
   server policy.

   *H1.8* RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for EPP host status
   values (e.g., ok, linked, client/server<command>Prohibited,
   pending<command>) and define their mapping to RPP responses and HTTP
   status codes.

18.3.2.  Operations

   *H2.1* RPP MUST RPP MUST provide operations to check, create, read,
   update and delete host objects as defined in [RFC5732], with partial
   update semantics available to allow for efficient updates.  Transfer
   Operation of subordinate host object MUST be implicit with the
   Transfer Operation of parent domain name.

   *H2.2* RPP SHOULD support searching and listing hosts filtered by
   name (exact/prefix), IP address, and Sponsoring Client, with
   pagination, the server MAY use a maximum limit on results.

   *H2.3* Only the Sponsoring Client (or an authorised server
   administrator) MAY modify or delete a host; servers MUST enforce
   authorisation.

   *H2.4* RPP MUST assure that In-bailiwick host objects are created and
   managed by the same Sponsoring Client as the parent domain name.

   *H2.5* RPP MUST enforce referential integrity.  A host referenced by
   any domain (linked) MUST NOT be deleted.  Servers MUST return a
   conflict error when deletion is disallowed and the host
   representation MAY include an attribute with information about linked
   objects.  RPP MUST allow for safe deletion of referenced hosts - with
   grace period, restore and prior removal of references as recommended
   in [RFC9874].

   *H2.6* RPP MUST prevent creation of duplicate hosts within a Registry
   namespace (TLD) and return a conflict on collision.

18.3.3.  Data Representation

   *H3.1* RPP MUST support a JSON representation for both Host objects
   and for Host attributes as defined in the EPP RFCs.

   *H3.2* The JSON representation MUST include the canonical host name
   and any U-label/A-label when IDN is used.

   *H3.3* The representation SHOULD include link relations to related
   objects, for example: self, and parent domain for In-bailiwick hosts.

18.4.  Contact Object Type

18.4.1.  Data Model

   *C1.1* RPP contact object data model MUST include, at a minimum an
   equivalent of RFC5733 contact data model: a unique identifier,
   repository object ID, current status, name, organisation, full postal
   address, voice and fax numbers, email addresses,the Sponsoring Client
   identifier, the creating client identifier, creation timestamp, the
   last updating client identifier, last update timestamp, last transfer
   timestamp, and authorisation information.

   *C1.2* RPP MUST support server-generated opaque IDs, support for
   client-supplied IDs is OPTIONAL.

   *C1.3* RPP SHOULD support an explicit indication of entity type
   (person or organisation) in the contact model.

   *C1.4* When RPP is used with thick Registries, full contact data MAY
   be returned, for thin Registries only the contact identifier MUST be
   returned.

   *C1.5* RPP MUST support disclosure and privacy preferences equivalent
   to EPP “disclose”.

   *C1.6* RPP MUST support contact object to refer to external identity
   provider (e.g. when digital identity schemes are used), where the
   personal data would not be persisted within RPP Server.  RPP SHOULD
   allow to only store a stable identifier, reference or credential for
   future verification (see Privacy Considerations).

   *C1.7* RPP MUST enforce referential integrity.  A contact MUST not be
   deleted when it is referenced by other objects.  RPP MUST return a
   conflict error when deletion is disallowed and the contact
   representation MAY include an attribute with information about linked
   objects.

   *C1.8* RPP SHOULD consider renaming the EPP contact object type to
   "entity" to better align with the RDAP data model, defined in
   [RFC9083].

18.4.2.  Operations

   *C2.1* RPP contact object type is mapped to the EPP equivalent and
   MUST support all operations (commands) defined for the contact object
   in [RFC5733], such as check, create, read, update, and delete with
   the possible exception of transfer command, and include support for
   partial update semantics available to allow for efficient updates.

   *C2.2* RPP MAY support the contact transfer command from EPP.

   *C2.3* RPP SHOULD support searching and listing contacts filtered by
   name (exact/prefix), and Sponsoring Client, with pagination, the
   server MAY use a maximum limit on results.

   *C2.4* Functional equivalents for EPP contact statuses (e.g., ok,
   linked, client/serverUpdateProhibited, client/serverDeleteProhibited,
   pendingTransfer) MUST be supported, with clear mapping to HTTP/RPP
   responses.  The protocol MUST define which statuses can be set by the
   server and which can be set by the Sponsoring Client.

   *C2.5* RPP MUST prevent creation of contacts with duplicate ids
   within Registry namespace (TLD) and return a HTTP 409 (Conflict)
   status on collision.

   *C2.6* The protocol MUST provide an operation to retrieve full
   contact representation.  An authorisation mechanism MUST ensure that
   sensitive data, such as authorisation information, is only returned
   to the current Sponsoring Client.

   *C2.7* The protocol MUST provide an operation to retrieve an
   appropriate contact representation to non-Sponsoring Clients.  The
   representation MAY vary depending if the authorisation information is
   provided - depending on server policy.

18.4.3.  Data Representation

   *C3.1* RPP SHOULD consider using JSContact [RFC9553] format for
   contact representation.

   *C3.2* RPP MUST support contact attribute disclosure preferences per
   field (or field group) and this MUST be mapped to the EPP disclosure
   preferences described in [RFC5733].

18.4.4.  Specific Considerations

18.4.4.1.  Internationalisation

   *C4.1* RPP MUST support internationalisation (character encoding) for
   contact objects in the following areas:

   -  name
   -  address data
   -  any other contact-related data containing human provided or
      readable text

   *C4.2* RPP MUST support both the localized and internationalised
   version of the EPP postalInfo element from [RFC5733].

   *C4.3* RPP MUST support internationalised Email addresses [RFC6530]
   in Contact objects.  Functional Equivalent of [RFC9873] MUST be
   assured in EPP compatibility mode, however RPP MAY remove requirement
   for at least one all-ASCII Email address.

   *C4.4* RPP MUST support multiple localised expressions of the same
   data, e.g. fields mentioned in C4.1 having both international and
   localised variants.

   *C4.5* All future RPP contact object extensions MUST be able to
   handle internationalisation and localisation requirements.

18.5.  Organisation Object Type

   *G1.1* RPP MUST support data model and operations defined for
   Organisations - Functional Equivalent of [RFC8543].

19.  IANA Considerations

   This document has several requirements for the RESTful Provisioning
   Protocol (RPP) that create considerations for IANA.  Future
   architecture and design documents may identify additional needs for
   IANA Registries.

   Therefore, the core RPP specifications MUST include "IANA
   Considerations" sections that formally request the creation of any
   necessary IANA Registries.  These sections MUST also provide the
   initial registration of values defined within those core documents.

20.  Security Considerations

   The security section of this document defines the security related
   requirements for RPP, these requirements MUST be addressed in the
   design and implementation of RPP.  Implementations MUST follow best
   practices, described in [BCP56] for HTTP API design.

   RRP core specifications MUST include appropriate Security
   Considerations sections, specifying implementation and operational
   security requirements for both RPP clients and servers.

21.  Privacy Considerations

   *DP1.1* The protocol MUST provide mechanisms to support the
   implementation of data privacy principles, such as those found in
   modern data protection frameworks (e.g., GDPR).  These mechanisms
   MUST support, at a minimum, the principles of data minimisation and
   purpose limitation.

   *DP.2* To support data minimisation, the protocol MUST allow clients
   to provide and manage only the data that is strictly necessary for a
   specific purpose.  The protocol MUST also allow for different
   representations of an object, so that a client can request a
   representation containing only the data it needs and server can
   return the data a client is authorised to access (See also R4.3 and
   R5.14).

   *DP1.3* The protocol's operations and data models MUST be
   sufficiently flexible to allow an operator to implement workflows for
   exercising data subject rights, such as access, rectification, and
   erasure of personal data, in a manner consistent with the operational
   and policy constraints of the provisioning environment.

   *DP1.4* The protocol MUST provide services to identify data
   collection policies and privacy practices.  Information about data
   collection, retention, and privacy policies MUST be included in the
   service discovery document, enabling clients to understand how
   personal and sensitive data is handled.

   *DP1.5* Object type specification MAY define additional requirements
   related to data privacy (See: C1.5, C2.6 and C2.7 for contact object
   type).

Appendix A.  Extensions

A.1.  Essential extensions

      |  TODO: These lists are far from being complete -> input from
      |  Tiger Team on EPP Extensibility will fill these lists

   The following list of extensions is considered essential for the
   completeness of RPP as provisioning protocol for domain names.  The
   core RPP and its extensibility framework MUST enable creation of
   those extensions.

   *A.1* _Moved to Appendix A.2 as A2.2_

   *A1.1* An extension that allows a DNS Operator to update the DNSSEC
   key material for a domain object.  This extension MAY be used by the
   DNS Operator to update the DNSSEC key material for a domain object,
   without the need for the registrar to be involved in this process.

   *A1.2* An extension for the clients to update their EPP compatible
   (client_id/password) authentication credential.

A.2.  Optional extensions

   The following list of extensions is considered as possible need for
   certain deployments of RPP, however other solutions outside of RPP
   would be possible.  Therefore RPP and its extensibility framework MAY
   enable creation of those extensions, however it is not a MUST
   criteria.

   *A2.1* An extension that allows generating a representation of a
   historical overview for an object, e.g. show all events linked to the
   object (create, update ...).  The historical time window is
   determined by server policy and ist included in the discovery service
   document.

   *A2.2* An extension for a Search API to allow for searching for
   objects in the Registry database.  Includes advanced search
   capabilities for object info request.
