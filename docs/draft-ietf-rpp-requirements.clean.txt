1.  Introduction

   This document describes the set of requirements for the RESTful
   Provisioning Protocol (RPP), an Application Programming Interface
   (API) for provisioning objects in a shared database.  RPP is based on
   the HTTP [RFC9110] protocol and the architectural principles of
   [REST].

2.  Terminology

   In this document the following terminology is used.

   REST - Representational State Transfer ([REST]).  An architectural
   style.

   RESTful - A RESTful web service is a web service or API implemented
   using HTTP and the principles of [REST].

   EPP RFCs - This is a reference to the EPP version 1.0 specifications
   [RFC5730], [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733].

   RESTful Provisioning Protocol or RPP - The protocol described in this
   document.

   URL - A Uniform Resource Locator as defined in [RFC3986].

   Resource - An object having a type, data, and possible relationship
   to other resources, identified by a URL.

   RPP client - An HTTP user agent performing an RPP request

   RPP server - An HTTP server responsible for processing requests and
   returning results in any supported media type.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  General

   *R1.1.* A well defined architecture MUST be defined for RPP,
   including a description of the responsibilities of the defined
   protocol layers.

   *R1.2.* _Removed_

   *R1.3.* Wherever applicable RPP SHOULD leverage existing best
   practices and well adopted standards for building and documenting
   RESTful APIs.  There MUST be a clear justification when deviating
   from this.

   *R1.4.* RPP MUST include support for application level status codes,
   and MAY reuse the EPP status codes defined in [RFC5730].

   *R1.5.* RPP MUST include support for providing detailed information
   about application status codes, for example as described in [RFC7807]

   *R1.6* RPP MUST support additional information about a successful
   operation (information or warning) to convey additional information
   to the client for example about deprecation or partial success.

5.  HTTP

   *R2.1.* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC9110] MUST be used
   as the transport mechanism for RPP.

   *R2.2.* RPP SHOULD use the best common practices for designing HTTP
   based applications, described in [BCP56].  There MUST be a clear
   justification when deviating from this.

   *R2.3.* Consistent, predictable and meaningful URL structures MUST be
   used for identifying, accessing object resources and enable request
   routing.

   *R2.4.* RPP MUST use the existing HTTP status codes and MUST define
   application level status codes and map these to HTTP status codes.
   RPP MUST NOT redefine existing HTTP status code semantics and when
   overloading (generic) HTTP status codes with multiple RPP status
   codes, the provided RPP status code MUST be used by the client to
   determine the exact nature of the problem.

6.  REST

   *R3.1.* The RPP architecture MUST use the principles of the [REST]
   architectural style.  A RPP server MUST conform to at least level 2
   of the [RICHARDSON] Maturity Model (RMM).

   *R3.2* The RPP architecture MUST follow Resource-Oriented
   Architecture [ROI].

   *R3.3.* The RPP specification MUST strive to minimise round trips
   between client and server.  Approaches, where client would need to
   make multiple requests each time to discover resource URL or server
   capabilities in order to perform operation SHOULD be used sparingly
   and be always well justified.

   *R3.4.* _Merged with R12.1_

   *R3.5.* RPP specifications SHOULD incorporate a machine-readable and
   well-established API specification, such as [!@OpenAPI] or [RAML].
   This will facilitate documentation, testing, code generation, and
   user-friendly extension descriptions.  RPP MUST NOT require what API
   specification technology is to be used.  The RPP core documents and
   extension documents may also choose different API specification
   solutions, this choice is left to the document authors.

7.  Data Model

   *R4.1* The base data model structures MUST be data format agnostic.
   It MUST be possible to map the base data model to multiple data
   formats such as JSON, XML or YAML.

   *R4.2* Commonly used EPP extensions SHOULD be added to the RPP core
   data model.  An example of this is the DNSSEC extension.

   *R4.3* RPP MUST allow an extension mechanism that allows clients to
   signal data omission or redaction, indicating data collected but not
   transmitted to the registry or redacted.

      |  TODO: Issue #34 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/34)

   *R4.4* RPP MUST have mechanisms to define profiles to indicate:

   -  Required parts of the data model
   -  Mapping definition
   -  Functional subsets for compatibility.

      |  TODO: Issue #15 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/15)

   *R4.5* The RPP architecture MUST include loose coupling between the
   server and the client, allowing for non-coordinated introduction of
   non-breaking version changes on both sides.

   *R4.6* A RPP MUST have either a lenient validation mode, where
   unknown properties are ignored, or a strict validation mode, where
   unknown properties are treated as an error.  The mode is up to client
   and server policy with mode signalling.”

8.  Data Representation

   *R5.1* RPP MUST use JSON as the default data format.

   *R5.2* It MUST be possible to extended RPP to include support other
   data formats (e.g. XML, YAML).

   *R5.3* Validation of request and response message MUST be supported
   for both clients and the servers, in order to determine if the
   content is valid and no required attributes are missing.

      |  TODO: Issue #36 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/36)

   *R5.4* RPP MUST define a default media type however the protocol
   SHALL be extensible to enable support for other media types.

   *R5.5* A client MUST be able to signal to the server what media type
   the server should expect for the request content and to use for the
   response content.

   *R5.6* _Removed_

   *R5.7* RPP SHOULD consider mechanisms for supporting data formats
   outside of core RPP domain.  Especially formats, which lose their
   properties if transformed, like Verifiable Credentials for contacts
   which are digitally signed.

   *R5.8* RPP MUST support partial update of data objects.

   *R5.9* RPP MUST support full update of data objects.

   *R.5.10* A generated RPP response representation that includes an
   object identifier (for example a contact handle) MUST also include a
   URL reference to the location of the object representation.

9.  Operations and responses

   *R6.1* RPP MUST include support for a client requesting different
   depth of data representations, depending on the use case:

   -  Minimal representation (ID, or ID+name)
   -  Full representation (all data of the object)
   -  Full representation + dereferenced referrals (for example domain
      with contact and host details)

   *R6.2* RPP MAY return different representations of the same object in
   different contexts:

   -  GET request to the resource itself
   -  GET request to get a collection of objects
   -  Responses to PUT/POST/PATCH requests

   *R6.3* The data representation in a RPP response MUST only contain
   data related to the object, transactional information MUST be
   represented as one or more separate HTTP headers.

      |  TODO: Issue #56 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/56)

10.  Discoverability

   *R7.1* RPP MAY include a bootstrap mechanism designed to allow
   clients to locate the network identifier for the RPP service of a
   registry operator, e.g. rpp.sidn.nl for the registry operator for the
   .nl ccTLD.

   Solutions may include:

   -  IANA bootstrap Service Registry
   -  DNS TXT records

   *R7.2* An RPP server MUST publish a service discovery document in the
   well-known directory, described in [RFC5785].  This document contains
   structured machine readable information that is required or useful
   for the client to be able to generate valid RPP requests.  The
   information may contain, but is not limited to:

   -  Available services,
   -  Used Extensions
   -  Versions used for services and extensions
   -  Environment name (production, test etc.)
   -  Server datetime
   -  Maintenance notices
   -  Supported profiles

   *R7.3* Server provided functionality, such as the set of supported
   profiles, languages or extensions, MUST discoverable using the
   discovery document.

   *R7.4* RPP MUST support versioning of:

   -  The protocol itself
   -  Data object types
   -  Representations
   -  Operations
   -  Profiles
   -  Extensions

   *R7.5* Versioning schema MUST carry information about breaking vs.
   non-breaking changes and allow clients to decide whether it is able
   to interact with the server.  The versioning scheme SHOULD be like
   the scheme used for HTTP where minor version changes do not break
   compatibility.

   *R7.6* Notices related to scheduled server maintenance timeslots MAY
   be included in the discovery document, this could be a human
   readable, non machine parsable character string.

   *R7.7* RPP MAY only support a subset of EPP functionality, the
   supported functionality MUST be discoverable by the client

   *R7.8* _Removed_

   *R7.9* An RPP response that includes unique object identifiers, MAY
   also include URL references for these objects.

   *R7.10* Versions used by the RPP protocol and used extensions MUST be
   discoverable by the client.

11.  EPP compatibility

   *R8.1* RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for core EPP
   functionalities related to domain name, host, and contact objects as
   defined in [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733].

   *R8.2* The automatic or mechanical mapping or conversion between EPP
   and RPP data model MUST be possible.

   *R8.3* Compatibility definitions for a RPP to EPP mapping MAY be
   defined in compatibility profiles (see: R4.4).

      |  TODO: Issue #15 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/15)

   *R8.4* RPP MUST include an extension framework able to define
   equivalents of most commonly used EPP extensions, which are not a
   part of core protocol (see: R4.2)

   *R8.5* EPP password based Authorisation Information defined in
   [RFC5731] and [RFC5733] MUST be supported in RPP.

   *R8.6* RPP SHOULD support client_id/password authentication to match
   EPP client authentication.

12.  Security

   *R9.1* RPP MUST support state-of-the-art authentication and
   authorisation schemes allowing for easy integration in modern HTTP
   infrastructure.

   *R9.2* RPP MUST support robust authentication and authorisation
   mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, to ensure that only
   authorised clients and users can access or modify resources.

   *R9.3* Support for a simplified and quicker object transfer process
   MAY be included, where approval from the losing registrar is to be
   obtained interactively by the registrant during the transfer process.

   *R9.4* RPP MUST include an authorisation model/framework that goes
   beyond the current EPP password based Authorisation Information
   (AuthInfo) used for object transfers.  The following use cases MAY be
   supported:

   -  Object transfers without using an EPP password based Authorisation
      Information
   -  Registrants using OpenID Connect can interactively allow DNS
      operator to update their NS records, directly in the registry
      database or indirectly using a registrar.

   *R9.5* All RPP communications MUST use HTTPS (TLS) to protect data in
   transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

   *R9.6* Security mechanisms SHOULD be flexible to allow operators to
   choose appropriate methods and support federated authentication
   scenarios.

   *R9.7* RPP MAY include a mechanism for cryptographic verification of
   request and response messages as an additional security layer.

   *R9.8* RPP MUST allow for multiple user accounts linked to a single
   registrar, registrar user management MAY be delegated to an
   administrator account linked to a registrar, allowing for self
   service account management by the registrar.

   *R9.9* RPP MUST support a granular authorisation matrix, where one or
   more permissions are coupled to a user account.  Allowing for the
   creation of different types of user accounts, such a readonly users
   only allowed to fetch data about existing objects, and power users
   allowed to create and modify objects.

   *R9.10* RPP MUST allow users to update their credentials and enforce
   strong passwords and limited lifetime for passwords and other tokens.

   *R9.11* RPP must support the Least Privilege Principle, to allow
   server operators to ensure that clients have only the permissions
   necessary.

   *R9.12* RPP MUST support secure credentials management, ensuring that
   credentials are protected against replay and theft, and have limited
   lifetimes.

   *R9.13* Any protocol extensions MUST be subject to the same security
   review and requirements as the core protocol.

   *R9.14* There MUST be mechanisms to revoke or deprecate credentials,
   tokens, or permissions when no longer needed or if compromised.

   *R9.15* RPP must support mechanisms to prevent Denial-of-Service
   attacks, whether from malicious actors or misbehaving clients.  These
   mechanisms can include rate limiting and throttling of requests with
   related protocol signalling.

13.  Extensibility

   *R10.1* The protocol MUST be extensible to accommodate new
   functionalities, data elements, and operations beyond the initial
   scope.

   *R10.2* RPP MUST allow for flexibility in extending the data model
   e.g. adding new objects or a new attribute to an existing object MUST
   be possible.

   *R10.3* RPP SHOULD promote standardisation of commonly used extension
   attributes.

   *R10.4* Extensions for new operations on existing resources MUST be
   supported.

      |  TODO: Issue #47 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/47)

   *R10.5* RPP MUST support extensions that define new status codes not
   already defined in the core RPP RFCs.

   *R10.6* RPP MUST support extensions adding new HTTP headers.

   *R10.7* RPP SHALL have mechanisms to assure conflict avoidance when
   extending the protocol, including but not limited to data model,
   representations, operations, parameters, error codes and signalling.
   There MUST be a mechanism of conflict-free, non-coordinated extending
   in private/vendor discretion as well as a coordinated process for
   core, generic or shared elements.

   *R10.8* When a public registry for RPP extensions is required, then
   IANA MUST be used for this function.

   *R10.9* RPP extensions MUST include support for versioning, the
   version of the extension supported by the server MUST be included in
   the discovery document.

   *R10.10* _Removed_

   *R10.11* Extension designers or RPP implementers MAY add new status
   codes, if a newly created status code is generic enough to be useful
   for the wider RPP community, then the extension designer SHOULD
   register the new status code in the RPP IANA registry.

14.  Scalability

   *R11.1* RPP MUST be stateless and MUST NOT maintain application state
   on the server required for processing future RPP requests.  Every
   client request needs to provide all the information required for the
   server to be able to successfully process the request.  The client
   MAY maintain application session state, for example by using a JWT
   token.

   *R11.2* RPP MUST support cacheability of responses, if applicable to
   the operation semantics and MUST not include transaction related
   identifiers and values.

      |  TODO: Issue #50 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/50)

   *R11.3* RPP MUST support load balancing at the level of request
   messages (URL) and load balancing MUST be possible without processing
   HTTP body.

   *R11.4* Every request message MUST at most contain a single object
   for the server to operate on, with the exception of operations that
   are explicitly defined as a bulk operation.

   *R11.5* RPP MUST support asynchronous processing for operations on
   multiple objects, otherwise resource intensive or involving manual
   steps.  The client request results in a confirmation of receipt and a
   means for retrieving the final completed processing result at a later
   time.

15.  Performance

   *R12.1* In order to minimise message sizes and needed processing RPP
   SHOULD be designed not to include a HTTP message body in the request
   or response when this is not necessary, for example when the required
   data can be transmitted using the URL and/or HTTP headers.

   *R12.2* RPP MAY allow for common bulk operations, resource listing,
   and filtering capabilities.  RPP MUST NOT mandate such
   functionalities where this may impact scalability or performance
   negatively.

   *R12.3* _Removed_

16.  Internationalisation

   *R13.1* RPP MUST support internationalisation, for object types and
   messages defined in the core protocol and extensions

   *R13.2* RPP MUST support human-readable localised response messages.

17.  Clients

   *R14.1* RPP MUST support server applications as clients.  This will
   be a primary use-case of registry/registrar integration.

   *R14.2* RPP MUST support interaction from command-line tools or
   desktop applications capable of sending HTTP requests.  These can be
   generic clients such as curl or Postman but also specialised RPP
   command line tools or scripts.

   *R14.3* RPP SHOULD support web browsers as clients, such as SPA
   (single page applications) without any proxy backend between web
   browser and the RPP server.

   *R14.4* RPP SHOULD support mobile applications as clients, also here
   through direct integration without any proxy backend.

18.  Requirements for object types

18.1.  Domain Object Type

18.1.1.  Internationalisation

   *D13.1* RPP MUST support Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs) - both
   UTF-8 as well as Punycode representation of a domain name MUST be
   supported, however one of them MAY be chosen as primary for object
   URL

18.2.  Host Object Type

18.3.  Contact Object Type

   *C1.1* The RPP contact object data model MUST include, at a minimum
   an equivalent of RFC5733 contact data model: a unique identifier,
   repository object ID, current status, name, organisation, full postal
   address, voice and fax numbers, email addresses,the sponsoring client
   identifier, the creating client identifier, creation timestamp, the
   last updating client identifier, last update timestamp, last transfer
   timestamp, and authorisation information.

   *C1.2* RPP MUST support server-generated opaque IDs, support for
   client-supplied IDs is OPTIONAL.

   *C1.3* RPP SHOULD support an explicit indication of entity type
   (person or organisation) in the contact model.

   *C1.4* When RPP is used with thick registries, full contact data MAY
   be returned, for thin registries only the contact identifier MUST be
   returned.

   *C1.5* RPP MUST support disclosure and privacy preferences equivalent
   to EPP “disclose”.

   *C1.6* RPP MUST support contact object to refer to external identity
   provider (e.g. when digital identity schemes are used), where the
   personal data would not be persisted within RPP server.  RPP SHOULD
   allow to only store a stable identifier, reference or credential for
   future verification (see Privacy Considerations).

   *C1.7* RPP MUST enforce referential integrity.  A contact MUST not be
   deleted when it is referenced by other objects.  RPP MUST return a
   conflict error when deletion is disallowed and the contact
   representation MAY include an attribute with information about linked
   objects.

   *C1.8* RPP SHOULD consider renaming the EPP contact object type to
   "entity" to better align with the RDAP data model, defined in
   [RFC9083].

18.3.1.  Operations

   *C2.1* The RPP contact object type is mapped to the EPP equivalent
   and MUST support all operations (commands) defined for the contact
   object in [RFC5733], such as check, create, read, update, and delete
   with the possible exception of transfer command, and include support
   for partial update semantics available to allow for efficient
   updates.

   *C2.2* RPP MAY support the contact transfer command from EPP.

   *C2.3* RPP MAY support searching and listing contacts filtered by
   name (exact/prefix), and sponsoring client, with pagination, the
   server MAY use a maximum limit on results.

   *C2.4* Functional equivalents for EPP contact statuses (e.g., ok,
   linked, client/serverUpdateProhibited, client/serverDeleteProhibited,
   pendingTransfer) MUST be supported, with clear mapping to HTTP/RPP
   responses.  The protocol MUST define which statuses can be set by the
   server and which can be set by the sponsoring client.

   *C2.5* RPP MUST prevent creation of contacts with duplicate ids
   within registry namespace (TLD) and return a HTTP 409 (Conflict)
   status on collision.

   *C2.6* The protocol MUST provide an operation to retrieve full
   contact representation.  An authorisation mechanism MUST ensure that
   sensitive data, such as authorisation information, is only returned
   to the current sponsoring client.

   *C2.7* The protocol MUST provide an operation to retrieve an
   appropriate contact representation to non-sponsoring clients.  The
   representation MAY vary depending if the authorisation information is
   provided - depending on server policy.

18.3.2.  Data Representation

   *C3.1* RPP SHOULD consider using JSContact [RFC9553] format for
   contact representation.

   *C3.2* RPP MUST support contact attribute disclosure preferences per
   field (or field group) and this MUST be mapped to the EPP disclosure
   preferences described in [RFC5733].

18.3.3.  Internationalisation

   *C4.1* RPP MUST support internationalisation (character encoding) for
   contact objects in the following areas:

   -  name
   -  address data
   -  any other contact-related data containing human provided or
      readable text

   *C4.2* RPP MUST support both the localized and internationalized
   version of the EPP postalInfo element from [RFC5733].

   *C4.3* RPP MUST support internationalised Email addresses [RFC6530]
   in Contact objects.

   *C4.4* RPP MUST support multiple localised expressions of the same
   data, e.g. fields mentioned in C4.1 having both international and
   localised variants.

   *C4.5* All future RPP contact object extensions MUST be able to
   handle internationalisation and localisation requirements.

19.  IANA Considerations

   This document has several requirements for the RESTful Provisioning
   Protocol (RPP) that create considerations for IANA.  Future
   architecture and design documents may identify additional needs for
   IANA registries.

   Therefore, the core RPP specifications MUST include "IANA
   Considerations" sections that formally request the creation of any
   necessary IANA registries.  These sections MUST also provide the
   initial registration of values defined within those core documents.

20.  Security Considerations

   The security section of this document defines the security related
   requirements for RPP, these requirements MUST be addressed in the
   design and implementation of RPP.  Implementations MUST follow best
   practices, described in [BCP56] for HTTP API design.

   RRP core specifications MUST include appropriate Security
   Considerations sections, specifying implementation and operational
   security requirements for both RPP clients and servers.

21.  Privacy Considerations

   *DP.1* The protocol MUST provide mechanisms to support the
   implementation of data privacy principles, such as those found in
   modern data protection frameworks (e.g., GDPR).  These mechanisms
   MUST support, at a minimum, the principles of data minimisation and
   purpose limitation.

   *DP.2* To support data minimisation, the protocol MUST allow clients
   to provide and manage only the data that is strictly necessary for a
   specific purpose.  The protocol MUST also allow for different
   representations of an object, so that a client can request a
   representation containing only the data it needs and server can
   return the data a client is authorised to access (See also R4.3 and
   R6.1).

   *DP.3* The protocol's operations and data models MUST be sufficiently
   flexible to allow an operator to implement workflows for exercising
   data subject rights, such as access, rectification, and erasure of
   personal data, in a manner consistent with the operational and policy
   constraints of the provisioning environment.

   *DP.4* The protocol MUST provide services to identify data collection
   policies and privacy practices.  Information about data collection,
   retention, and privacy policies MUST be included in the service
   discovery document, enabling clients to understand how personal and
   sensitive data is handled.

Appendix A.  Extensions

A.1.  Essential extensions

      |  TODO: These lists are far from being complete -> input from
      |  Tiger Team on EPP Extensibility will fill these lists

   The following list of extensions is considered essential for the
   completeness of RPP as provisioning protocol for domain names.  The
   core RPP protocol and its extensibility framework MUST enable
   creation of those extensions.

   *A.1* _Moved to Appendix A.2 as A2.2_

   *A1.1* An extension that allows a DNS operator to update the DNSSEC
   key material for a domain object.  This extension MAY be used by the
   DNS operator to update the DNSSEC key material for a domain object,
   without the need for the registrar to be involved in this process.

A.2.  Optional extensions

   The following list of extensions is considered as possible need for
   certain deployments of RPP, however other solutions outside of RPP
   would be possible.  Therefore RPP and its extensibility framework MAY
   enable creation of those extensions, however it is not a MUST
   criteria.

   *A2.1* An extension that allows generating a representation of a
   historical overview for an object, e.g. show all events linked to the
   object (create, update ...).  The historical time window is
   determined by server policy and ist included in the discovery service
   document.

      |  TODO: Issue #57 (https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/rpp-
      |  requirements/issues/57)

   *A2.2* An extension for a Search API to allow for searching for
   objects in the registry database.  Includes advanced search
   capabilities for object info request.
